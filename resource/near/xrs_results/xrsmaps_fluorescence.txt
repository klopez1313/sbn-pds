This writeup is was developed as part of the NEAR XGRS
submission to NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS).  The contents
are specific to the NEAR XRS Level 3 partition of the dataset
and are from the Nittler, 2001 MAPS paper. Tables 1-4 are listed
at the end of the first section.

XRS Results
-----------

Elemental ratios for Eros have been determined for areas sampled
by the XRS during five solar flares and two extended integrations
during quiescent solar conditions. Some basic characteristics
for these data are provided in Table 1, including the date and
UT of each flare, the total integration time used in spectral
sums, the average latitude and longitude of the instrument
footprint on the asteroid surface and the average temperature
of the solar plasma, determined from the Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-8). GOES measures
the solar x-ray flux in two wavelength bands every three
seconds. Isothermal plasma temperatures are determined from the
flux measurements by convolving theoretical solar spectra with
instrument response functions to generate calibration curves.
The estimated uncertainty in derived temperature is 10-20%.

Background-subtracted pulse-height spectra for the five flares
and two quiet Sun integration periods are given in Figures 2
and 3. For each flare spectrum, the background is the sum of
all spectra acquired the same day during periods when the
instrument field of view did not include solar-illuminated
asteroid and scaled to the same integration time as the flare
spectral sum. Background for quiet Sun spectra
are sums of all off-pointing spectra acquired over the same
time period as the summed fluorescence spectrum. Errors on
indivudal channel counts are based on counting statistics. Each
asteroid-pointing spectrum was fitted using a non-linear
least-squares technique to extract count rates of characteristic
photons from Mg, Al,Si, S, Ca and Fe incident on the XRS. The
best spectral fits are included in Figures 2 and 3. From the
fits, photon ratios Mg/Si, Al/Si,S/Si, Ca/Si and S/Si were
derived, along with statistical errors. These are provided in
Table 3.

Conversion of x-ray photon ratios to elemental abundance
ratios requires knowledge of the incident solar x-ray spectrum.
For the Eros flare spectra, solar spectra acquired by the solar
monitor detector during the same integration period were fitted
to derive plasma temperatures. This fitting procedure involved
convolving theoretical solar spectra of different temperatures
through the response function of the solar monitor filter and
minimizing the difference between synthetic and
observed spectra. For each flare, two fits were performed: F1
was a two temperature fit to the full solar monitor spectrum;
F2 is a single temperature fit to the high energy portion
(5-10 keV) of the spectrum. For more discussion of solar
modeling see Figure 4 and GOES, Solar Modeling discussion in
appendix of this paper.

Given an observation geometry (determined from a shape model of
Eros and spacecraft pointing data) and a solar spectrum,
theoretical fluorescence and coherent backscatter models are
used to generate calibration curves relating photon ratios to
elemental ratios. Standard analytical models of x-ray scatter
and fluorescence were performed for a wide range of compositions,
typical of different meteorite types, and solar temperatures.
Figure 6 gives example calibration curves for Mg/Si and Fe/Si.
The x-ray models assume a homogeneous composition of the observed
sample, but in real rocks different elements are contained
in different minerals. To account for this, a correction is
applied to elemental ratios derived from the model calibration
curves. The correction factor calculated for four meteorite types
is given in Table 2; for the results included here the average
chondrite correction factor (last column) was applied.

Elemental ratios derived for each flare and quiet sun spectrum
are given in Table 3. Flare results for solar monitor fits F1
and F2 are given separately. S/Si, Ca/Si and Fe/Si ratios are
only derived for the brighter flares for which sufficient signal
was obtained. The average element ratios of Eros, determined from
the individual analyses, is provided in Table 4. The F1 results
for the May 4 and June 15 flares and the F2 result for the
December 27 flare are believed to be in error, due
to errors in solar modeling, and are not included in the average.
The standard deviation of individual S/Si results is within 1 sigma
of zero and a two-sigma upper limit is provided for this ratio.
For the other ratios, three error estimates are provided.
Sigma_stat is the statistical error bar, based on the standard
error of the mean of the individual results. Sigma_var is the
standard deviation of individual results; this includes both
the effects of any km-scale heterogeneity on the asteroids'
surface and a systematic error due to incorrect modeling
of solar monitor spectra. Sigma_sys is the total systematic
error. This was calculated in quadrature from three sources of
error: the error in the mineral mixing correction factor
(Table 2), a 10% error due to uncertain elemental abundance
variations in the solar corona, and sigma_var to account for
errors in solar modeling.

* For solar flares, element ratios were derived for two theoretical solar spectra: F1: two-temperature fit to
  solar monitor, F2: single temperature fit to high energy portion of solar monitor (see text). Element ratios
  for quiet Sun were derived using GOES temperatures (Table 1).

GOES Processing Issues:
-----------------------
From the ratio of the two channels the temperature is computed
either from the parameterized fit in Thomas et al (Solar Physics
v95, 1983) or by interpolating from a lookup table computed by
folding the GOES transfer functions with the MEWE emission line
and continuum spectrum calculated by MEWE_SPEC.PRO.  The responses
of the GOES ionization chamber were obtained from Donnelly et al
1977.  The responses for GOES8+ were obtained by a private
communication from Howard Garcia to Hugh Hudson subsequently
passed along to Richard Schwartz and implemented in July 1996.
Tables for GOES6 and GOES7 were communicated by Garcia to Schwartz
on 10 Oct 1996.  The most recent version, Nov 22 1996, corrects
the Thomas parameterization by including the change in definition
for the transmission-averaged short wavelength flux which occurred
from GOES4 onward.  These are reported in the GBAR_TABLE produced
by GOES_TRANSFER.PRO While there are real changes in the response
between versions of GOES, this was a simple change of divisor
from (4-0.5) to (3-0.5) and not in any real difference between
detectors such as a change in thickness of the beryllium window.
This change of definition results in the higher values found in
Table 1 of Garcia, Sol Phys, v154, p275.  This issue is disussed
on page 284 in paragraph 2 of section 3.1 of Garcia.

An alternative interpolation table was created by Howard Garcia
and reported by private communication and partially published
in Solar Physics v154, p275. The tables for GOES2, GOES6, GOES7,
and GOES8 have been renormalized to 1e49 cm-3 and the ratio
taken the ratio of the long current divided by the short current
as given by Garcia.

References for Solar Modeling and Temperature
---------------------------------------------
Extensive calculations of solar emission over a wide range of
temperatures (4 to 30 million Kelvins) include both continuum and
line emissions from less than 1 to greater than 10 KeV.  Continuum
is derived from computations of Landini and Fossi (1970) for
coronal continuum production (free-free+free-bound radiation)
with a correction (Karzas and Latter, 1961) for free-free emission.
Calculation of the extensive spectral lines in the soft X-ray
region for major elements C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, K,
Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni, that result from both resonant and
non-resonant transitions, are based on the work of Landini and
Fossi (1970) and Mewe (1972), with improved excitation
cross-sections provided by Mewe (1972).  (See Mewe, 1972,

Physics 22, 459-491.)
