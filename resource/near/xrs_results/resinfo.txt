Observed and best fit model Soft X-ray spectra (0 to 10 KeV)                   
obtained from NEAR XGRS solar monitor and three asteroid                       
pointing detectors (bare, Mg filter, and Al filter) during                     
five solar flares (a through e) which occurred during the NEAR                 
mision orbital phase.  Two theoretical spectra for the solar monitor           
correspond to best solar two temperature and one temperature above             
4 KeV fit to observed spectra.  Theoretical spectra for asteroid               
pointing detectors are best fit using Levenberg-Marquardt least                
squares minimization.  All spectra have had background removed.                
A typical background during that time was removed from the solar               
monitor spectrum, and a background removed using the method from               
the asteroid pointing detectors.

Observed and best fit model soft X-ray spectra (0.5 to 3 KeV                   
obtained from NEAR XGRS three asteroid pointing detectors (bare,               
Mg filter, and Al filter) during solar quiescence in summer (a)                
and winter (b) halves of the mission, respectively.  Lower energy              
lines (for Mg and Si at 1.25 and 1.75 respectively) are clearly                
observable during quiescent times.  Theoretical spectra for                    
asteroid pointing detectors are best fit using Levenberg-Marquardt             
least squares minimization.  All spectra have had background                   
removed.  A typical background during that time was removed                    
from the solar monitor spectrum, and a background removed using
