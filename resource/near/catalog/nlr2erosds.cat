    Data Set Overview
    =================
    The NEAR Laser Rangefinder (NLR) Level 2 Data Products include
    the along-track profiles of NLR data in SI units, together with
    spacecraft position, orientation, and timing data. The radius of
    433 Eros with respect to its center of mass is the primary profile
    parameter.

    Surface slope and topographic relief are not as easily
    defined on an irregular object as on the Earth. We provide the
    geopotential arising from the mass of the asteroid and its rotation,
    based on the NLR shape model NLR125AR.IMG,
    a rotation rate of 3.3166E-04 rad s^(-1), and an assumed homogeneous
    density of 2670 kg m^(-3). Geophysical studies may use the potential as a
    proxy for topographic height, scaled by a regional average gravitational
    acceleration [CHENGETAL2001].

    Ranges from level 1 NLR data are the source of the level 2 data product.
    Precision orbits were generated at NASA-GSFC, and supplemented where
    appropriate by JPL navigation team orbits, ancillary timing and attitude
    information supplied by the NEAR SDC and instrument data derived from
    in-flight analysis. These data were merged to create the calibrated
    profile data. Each level 2 data product is a text format table
    corresponding to a daily level 1 EDR file, and is described by a detached
    label. The file naming convention is LyydddNv.TAB, where L=laser, and
    yyddd contains the two-digit year and the three-digit day of observation.
    The letter v stands for processing version. Version 'D' is based
    on the most recent JPL navigation team orbits, version 'G' and 'J' on 
    GSFC's precision orbit series 393, where version 'J' is supplemented by
    JPL orbits at times of spacecraft maneuvers.
    There is only one version of the data for each specific orbit on the
    volume.

    The orbital mission phase employed only normal format packets. In these
    packets, the spacecraft mission elapsed time (MET) is recorded at the
    time of the first major frame in the packet. A normal rate packet
    contains up to 56 observations, so that the last observation may occur
    up to 55 seconds after the nominal packet time in the case of
    1 Hz data.
    The SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_STOP_COUNT and STOP_TIME values reflect the time
    recorded in the last packet for a given UTC day. Thus the last
    observation may occur later than the nominal STOP_TIME.

    Parameters
    ==========
    Profiles are tables of longitude, latitude, and radius at the laser
    bounce point, together with time stamps, the spacecraft position, and
    instrument threshold setting.

    Processing
    ==========
    Ranges are converted from counts to meters of one-way range from NLR to
    433 Eros as described in the calibration document NLRCALIB.TXT.
    Precision orbit data for the NEAR-Shoemaker spacecraft is provided by
    the NASA-GSFC analysis team and the JPL navigation team, and is archived
    in the form of SPICE format spacecraft ephemeris (SPK) files. The MET
    time associated with each shot, with minor frame given in decimal
    seconds, is converted to Ephemeris Time in seconds past J2000 (ET) using
    the project's time conversion (SCLK) file. The spacecraft position at
    the ET shot time is interpolated from the SPK file. The spacecraft
    orientation SPICE file (CK) is resampled at 1-second intervals of whole
    seconds. Its quaternions are convolved with a 9-point, centered,
    finite-impulse-response filter to reduce high-rate gyro noise before
    conversion to matrix form.
    
    The filtered spacecraft orientation matrix transforms vectors from the
    J2000 inertial reference frame to the instrument deck
    (NEAR_SC_BUS_PRIME) frame. Observations are directed toward the
    positive X'-axis in this frame.  A fixed boresight offset with respect
    to this frame is assumed.  The Euler angles of the boresight are
    provided as a SPICE instrument kernel (IK) file, from which a
    transformation matrix from NEAR to NLR frame is derived.

    The J2000-to-NLR frame matrix is calculated from the smoothed CK by
    matrix composition.  The one-way time-of-flight from the laser range
    is added to the laser fire time to obtain the bounce point time, and
    the calibrated one-way range vector is projected from the spacecraft
    state at this time along the boresight to obtain the surface bounce
    point position in inertial coordinates with respect to the asteroid
    center of mass.  The inertial position is then rotated to the
    asteroid body-fixed coordinate system using satellite/planet position
    and orientation files (PCK) supplied by the project.

    The asteroid-located radius vector is given in both radial coordinates
    and as a Cartesian position vector. The angle subtended by the bounce
    point to NEAR spacecraft position vector and the radius vector is
    calculated. This angle is loosely termed the EMISSION_ANGLE, assuming
    a spherical body. Normally an emission angle greater than 90 degrees
    would indicate a missed shot, but due to the irregular shape of
    433 Eros, emission angles >120 degrees were obtained. The angle
    subtended by the NEAR to Eros center vector and the NEAR to bounce point
    vector (OFF_NADIR angle) is also provided.
    
    Lastly, the potential due to gravity and rotation at the shot
    location is calculated [CHENGETAL2001] assuming
    a uniform density of 2670 kg m^-3 and the  NLR125AR.IMG shape model.
    The potential is evaluated via a surface integral over a 2 by 2 degree
    grid, refined to 1/4 by 1/4 degree in the vicinity of the shot.

    Data
    ====
      Data are stored on CD-WO volumes. A CD volume was created
      for delivery of data to PDS.

      ASCII profiles are stored in the /LEVEL2/TOPO directory with file
      names of the form LyydddNv.TAB, where yy and ddd are numeric year
      and day-of-year, v is a version identifier, and TAB denotes that
      this is an ASCII table.

    Ancillary Data
    ==============
      None.

    Coordinate System
    =================
      NLR data files use an EROS centered body-fixed coordinate
      system with positive east longitude. The transformation from
      inertial (J2000) coordinates to body-fixed is represented by the
      project-supplied SPICE format attitude and orientation files
      used to generate level 2 data products.

    Software
    ========
      None.

    Media/Format
    ============
      The archival data set was written on CD-WO by the NEAR/NLR
      Project.  The CD-WO volumes conform to ISO 9660 Level 2
      standards."

    Overview
    ========
      Data in this archive have been reduced as part of mission data
      analysis activities of the NEAR/NLR Science Team.

    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was reviewed by the NEAR/NLR Science
      Team prior to final submission to the Planetary Data
      System (PDS).

      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of
      example PDS labels, example data files, CATALOG files, and other
      relevant documentation.  These materials were distributed to
      PDS personnel, the experiment investigator, and others, as
      appropriate.

    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
       The data coverage was determined by the orientation of the
       instrument X' axis during science data acquisition by several
       instruments. NLR did not control pointing for the bulk of the
       time, so the coverage is largely unplanned. Nevertheless,
       sufficient density of coverage was obtained in all of the orbit
       phases to resolve topography of features greater than 50 m
       in extent.

    Limitations
    ===========
      The limitations in this data set follow from the quality of
      the execution, which is described above under Data Coverage
      and Quality."
