The GRS Level 2 data products in this archive include daily                   
time series of spectra collected by the instrument along with                 
selected spacecraft engineering and instrument configuration and              
orbital ephemerides. Supporting documentation includes as to the              
specifics of how these data were generated. Selected ephemerides              
and engineering parameters are averaged for the composite set of              
information.

The Level 2 data products comprise the time series of the GRS                 
instrument's science data in physical units. At each integration              
time the instrument Data Processing Unit (DPU) samples instrument             
spectra accumulated during the integration period as well as                  
instrument and engineering configuration information.  Ground                 
processing activities at the University of Arizona produce Derived            
Engineering and Spatial Ephemerides information.  The Level-2 data            
are then combined into integral products within a relational                  
database and exported as an integral Level-2 product. Each GRS record         
is comprised of the following logical data units:
