These data underwent peer review on April 9, 1999. At the time of review,     
the filter bandpass files were provided as document files, but a lien         
was placed requiring that they be packaged as a separate data set with        
detached labels appropriate for ASCII tabular data.  This was done in April   
1999.  The data files themselves are unchanged.
