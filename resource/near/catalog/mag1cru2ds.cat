      This data set contains the NEAR magnetometer (MAG) data for             
      the CRUISE2 phase. The data set begins on                          
      1997-06-28T00:00:00.000  and ends 1998-01-22T23:59:59.999 .             
      The data are raw telemetry data, provided in engineering units,         
      that have been reformatted into FITS file format (NASA Office           
      of Science and Technology (NOST), 100-1.0). In addition to the          
      raw magnetometer data, a calibration file and algorithm are             
      available. This data set is archived as a set of CDROM images           
      as a part of the NEAR EDR volume set.                                   
                                                                              
      The data set directory structure is shown below. The first volume of    
      the set is the only volume which contains CATALOG, DOCUMENT             
      and other non-data subdirectories. Subsequent volumes contain           
      only DATA and INDEX subdirectories in order to minimize duplication.
