    Data Set Overview                                                         
    =================                                                         
      This data set includes the complete set of SPICE data for one NEAR      
      mission phase in the form of SPICE kernels, which can be accessed       
      using SPICE software available to read these files.                     
                                                                              
      The SPICE data contains geometric and other ancillary information       
      needed to recover the full value of science instrument data. In         
      particular SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary               
      ephemerides, instrument mounting alignments, spacecraft orientation     
      and spacecraft sequences of events. Data needed for relevant time       
      conversions is also included.                                           
                                                                              
       This data set is possibly spread across multiple volumes, each         
       containing the complete set of SPICE kernels for two or more mission   
       phases, a single mission phase or a portion of a mission phase.        
       The volume coverages are summarized in the table:

    Data Types (SPICE kernel types)                                           
    ===============================                                           
      SPK kernels contain ephemerides for spacecraft, planets, satellites,    
      comets and asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and      
      instrument structures. They provide position and velocity, given in     
      a Cartesian reference frame. SPK files are located under the            
      GEOMETRY/SPK directory.                                                 
                                                                              
      PCK kernels contain certain physical, dynamical and cartographic        
      constants for target bodies, such as size and shape specifications,     
      and orientation of the spin axis and prime meridian. PCK files are      
      located under the GEOMETRY/PCK directory.                               
                                                                              
      IK kernels (Instrument description kernels) give descriptive and        
      operational data peculiar to a particular scientific instrument,        
      such as internal timing relative to the spacecraft clock and            
      field-of-view model parameters. IK files are located under the          
      GEOMETRY/IK directory.                                                  
                                                                              
      CK kernels describe pointing, containing a transformation               
      traditionally called the C-matrix which is used to determine            
      time-tagged pointing (orientation) angles for a spacecraft structure    
      upon which science instruments are mounted. CK files are located        
      under the GEOMETRY/CK directory.                                        
                                                                              
      LSK (Leapseconds) kernels contain the leapseconds and the values of     
      other constants required to perform a transformation between            
      Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET). LSK files     
      are located under the GEOMETRY/LSK directory.                           
                                                                              
      SCLK (Spacecraft Clock) kernels contain on-board clock calibration      
      data required to perform a mapping between Ephemeris time (ET) and      
      spacecraft on-board time (SCLK.) SCLK files are located under the       
      GEOMETRY/SCLK directory.                                                
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Software                                                                  
    ========                                                                  
      The SPICE Toolkit contains software modules needed to read SPICE        
      kernel files. SPICELIB software is highly documented via internal       
      headers. Additional documentation is available in separate ASCII        
      text files called Required Reading files. For example, the S- and P-    
      Kernel (SPK) Required Reading File, named SPK.REQ, describes use of     
      the SPK kernel file readers and contains sample programs.               
                                                                              
      The latest SPICE Toolkit for a variety of computer platforms such as    
      PC, Mac, SUN, HP, SGI, VAX, DEC Alpha, NeXT, etc. is available at       
      the NAIF Node of PDS electronically (via anonymous FTP and WWW          
      servers). Each version of the Toolkit is also archived at the NASA      
      National Space Science Data Center."

    =========================                                                 
      This volume contains SPICE kernel files created during mission          
      operations only. No post processing has been done on these data.        
                                                                              
    SPK Files

      Two kinds of SPK files are provided in this archive: SPK files for      
      the spacecraft orbit and SPK files for EROS, Earth and Sun.             
                                                                              
      Spacecraft Orbit SPK Files                                              
      --------------------------                                              
      SPK files are for the spacecraft are created by the NEAR JPL            
      Navigation team. The kernels in this archive are specifically           
      created for science users and distributed through the Science Data      
      Center. These kernels are merged from a series of operations SPK        
      kernels. The merged kernels remove all of the predicted data from       
      the operations kernel, except the final predicted segment in the        
      kernel. For science use they must be loaded sequentially by the         
      spice kernel load routines, so that the oldest are loaded first.        
      This will ensure that reconstructed values are used whenever possible.  
                                                                              
      Solar System Body SPK Files                                             
      ---------------------------                                             
      The solar system body SPK files were provided by the JPL Navigation     
      team by way of the NAIF group.  The accuracies for the bodies in each   
      file can be obtained by inspecting the comment portion of each file     
      using the COMMNT utility from the SPICE toolkit, which is available     
      from NAIF.  The asteroid SPK files were provided directly from the JPL  
      Navigation team.  The comment portion of the Mathilde and Eros SPK      
      files provide detailed information regarding their usage and accuracy.  
                                                                              
                                                                              
    CK Files                                                                  
    ========                                                                  
      C-kernel files provide orientation of the spacecraft. With the          
      exception of NIS, the NEAR instruments have fixed orientation. MSI,     
      NIS, XGRS and NLR all nominally are oriented along the spacecraft       
      positive X-axis. The Solar panels and high gain antenna are             
      nominally oriented in the positive z-axis. The small difference of      
      instrument orientation from the X-axis are given in the instrument      
      kernel (IK) files. The data Ck files are taken directly from the        
      attitude telemetry produced by the spacecraft Flight Computer (FC).     
      The FC data is reformatted at full resolution into the Ck files. No     
      interpolation is done on these data.                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
    EK Files                                                                  
    ========                                                                  
      Events kernel files are often used to digitally represent an            
      experimenter's notebook( ENB EK's) or to list a summary of all commands 
      sent to a spacecraft, as is the case with Sequence EK's.  In the case   
      of NEAR,  E-kernels are used in a very different way:  to efficiently   
      represent the shape of EROS. This representation is often referred to   
      as a 'shape' or 'plate' model.  There are two plate models of EROS in   
      this delivery, one at a lower resolution, having only 1566 plates and   
      another at a higher resolution, having 7516 plates.  These plate        
      E-kernels are specifically designed for use with the SPICE plate        
      library, developed specifically for NEAR.  This library is used to      
      perform geometric calculations related to fields of view, observing     
      geometry, etc. for shape models defined as a plate E-Kernel.  The       
      plate library can be obtained by contacting NAIF.                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
    PCK Files                                                                 
    =========                                                                 
      PCK files provide size, shape and orientation data for 'target'         
      bodies such as Mathilde and EROS. A description of these data items     
      and reference to their source is provided inside the text PCK files,    
      which is a simple text file that can be viewed using any word           
      processor, text editor or text display utility.  The binary PCK files   
      contain a comment area for each file.  SPICE Toolkit utilities like     
      SPACIT and COMMNT can be used to extract the comments from these        
      files.

      Instrument kernel files provide specifications for the mounting         
      alignment and where applicable field-of-view size, shape and            
      orientation for the named instrument. Metadata describing these         
      estimates are provided in each IK file included in this archive.        
      Parameter values were determined from pre-launch measurements or        
      from manufacturing blueprints.

    ==========                                                                
      Spacecraft Clock kernel files provide a tabulation of data needed       
      for converting time measurements between ephemeris time (ET) and        
      spacecraft clock time (SCLK). The SPICE SCLK file is produced by the    
      NEAR Mission Operations Center.                                         
                                                                              
      The time correlation accuracy provided in SCLK files is informally      
      reported by the MOPS team to be better 20 milliseconds during           
      orbital phases. This accuracy has been corroborated by independent      
      estimates to within 500ms.                                              
                                                                              
      SPICE software does not prohibit an SCLK file from being used for       
      time conversions occurring for 'future times' (or more accurately,      
      for epochs that occur later than the epoch of the last telemetry        
      data used in producing the last correlation coefficients found in       
      the SCLK file). Such 'predict' time conversions are likely to be        
      inaccurate (changed somewhat) once the epoch of interest has been       
      passed.                                                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
    LSK Files

      Leapseconds kernel files provide a tabulation of 'leapseconds' and      
      some other terms used in converting time measurements between           
      ephemeris time (ET) and Universal Time (UTC). 'Spacecraft Event         
      Time' (SCET) is the commonly used name for UTC events measured at       
      the spacecraft.                                                         
                                                                              
      Metadata describing how the LSK data are obtained or computed is        
      contained inside the LSK text file. The time conversion provided by     
      SPICE LSK files is accurate to approximately 0.000030 seconds."
