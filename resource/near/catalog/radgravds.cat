    =================                                                         
      This data set includes a 15x15 gravity model for Eros derived           
      from radio and landmark tracking of the NEAR spacecraft, several        
      images/maps, and a file of surface landmarks.  The gravity model and    
      images/maps were produced by Alex Konopliv of the NEAR                  
      Radio Science Team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  The          
      landmark file was compiled by the NEAR Navigation Team and was          
      used in the solution for the gravity field.                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Parameters                                                                
    ==========                                                                
      The gravity model is defined by a set of spherical harmonic             
      coefficients -- GM, Cmn, and Smn.  These can be evaluated to            
      give the gravitational potential of Eros.  Both ASCII (data type        
      SHA) and binary (data type SHB) formats are defined, with the           
      latter including covariance terms.  Each file contains up to            
      four tables: a header table containing general parameters for           
      the model (gravitational constant, its uncertainty, degree and          
      order of the field, normalization state, reference longitude,           
      and reference latitude); a names table, giving the order in             
      which coefficients appear; a coefficients table (degree m,              
      order n, coefficients Cmn and Smn, and their uncertainties);            
      and a covariances table giving the covariances of CijCmn,               
      SijSmn, CijSmn, and SijCmn.                                             
                                                                              
      The image files are digital maps of Bouguer anomaly and radial          
      gravity acceleration where the gravity field has been evaluated         
      to degree and order less than the full 15x15 range in the model.        
      The truncation reduces noise in the maps resulting from                 
      uncertainty in the higher degree and order coefficients.                
                                                                              
      The landmark file contains rotation information for Eros and            
      X, Y, and Z coordinates for the centers of craters identified           
      on its surface.                                                         
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Processing                                                                
    ==========                                                                
      Spherical harmonic models and maps were derived from raw radio          
      tracking data in several steps.                                         
                                                                              
      The gravity field coefficients were obtained by solving systems         
      of equations with about 5000 unknowns.  Radio tracking data             
      in long arcs were delimited mostly by propulsive maneuvers              
      and were used in solutions which were obtained iteratively              
      and by least squares.                                                   
                                                                              
      Maps of vertical gravity acceleration and Bouguer anomaly were          
      generated from the spherical harmonic model(s) evaluated at             
      regular grid points.

      This archival data set was reviewed by the NEAR Radio Science           
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Data System (PDS).            
      It was one of several data sets included in a comprehensive             
      review by the PDS Small Bodies Node in August 2001, prior to            
      PDS acceptance and ingestion.                                           
                                                                              
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data             
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for                   
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of              
      example PDS labels and example data files.

      The data included in this archive were collected during the             
      NEAR orbital phase from 2000-02-14 to 2001-02-12.                       
      See 'DESCRIPTION' in the label file for JGE15A01.SHA for more           
      information about the data included in this gravity solution.

      The limitations in this data set follow from the quality of
