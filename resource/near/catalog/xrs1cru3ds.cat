      This data set contains X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) observations            
      made during the third cruise phase of the NEAR mission. The             
      individual observations are combined into a single file per day         
      for each sensor.

      The data are presented as FITS binary tables (using the BINTAB          
      extension) with detached PDS labels. The parameters listed in           
      each table vary with observing sensor. The detailed descriptions        
      of the various parameters included in the table are given in a          
      separate documentation file, one for each sensor:
