   ==================                                                         
   It was found that the on surface attitude of the spacecraft did            
   not facilitate the use of the fixed high gain antenna and the              
   low gain antenna was used for the duration of the on-surface               
   mission.  As a result available telemetry rates did not                    
   facilitate the downlink of the full complement of instrument,              
   engineering and ancillary information with priority being                  
   given to selected spectra.  The first two days of on-surface               
   activity were used to calibrate the detectors to account for               
   deviations of temperature between orbital and on surface                   
   operations.  Adjustments were then made to the instrument high             
   voltage to improve the energy gain in the escape peak spectra.             
                                                                              
   In this configuration, several long term integrations were                 
   collected and spectra taken for the 3 longest integrations                 
   and ancillary information.                                                 
                                                                              
   Each of set of spectra were corrected for channel rollover                 
   which occured in several instances due to long integration                 
   times causing accumulations of counts in some channels to                  
   exceed and rollover the maximum numerical range of the 2 byte              
   channel.  Higher counting rates in the lower energies of each              
   spectrum incurred multiple rollovers and algorithms were                   
   developed to rectify this effect.                                          
                                                                              
   A second correction made to the on-surface spectra is the                  
   removal of differential non-linearities (DNL) contained within             
   the spectra. The effect being high frequency spikes in                     
   channels spaced at regular intervals within the spectrum.                  
   (DNL)`s were removed using a 3rd order polynomial fit and                  
   smoothing function for a sliding boxcar of 21 channels                     
   through each raw spectrum.  The result is then provided as a GRS           
   Level-3 spectrum.
