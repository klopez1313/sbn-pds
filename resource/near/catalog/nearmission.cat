    ================                                                          
                                                                              
      The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission inaugurated           
      NASA's Discovery Program. It was the first mission to orbit an          
      asteroid and made the first comprehensive scientific                    
      measurements of an asteroid's surface composition, geology,             
      physical properties, and internal structure. NEAR was launched          
      successfully on 17 February 1996 aboard a Delta II-7925. It made        
      the first reconnaissance of a C-type asteroid during its flyby          
      of the main-belt asteroid 253 Mathilde in June 1997. It became          
      the first spacecraft to enter orbit around an asteroid, doing so        
      at the large near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros in February 2000. The         
      spacecraft, renamed NEAR Shoemaker, landed on Eros at 37.2 South        
      by 278.4 West, ending its mission on February 12, 2001 with             
      another spacecraft first. NEAR obtained new information on the          
      nature and evolution of asteroids, improved our understanding of        
      planetary formation processes in the early solar system, and            
      clarified the relationships between asteroids and meteorites.           
      The NEAR Mission Operations Center and Science Data Center were         
      both located at APL. The latter maintained the entire NEAR data         
      set on-line and made data from all instruments accessible over          
      the Internet to every member of the NEAR science team.  For a           
      detailed description of the mission see [CHENGETAL1998].                
                                                                              
   Introduction                                                               
   ============                                                               
      Of the more than 7000 asteroids that have been named, most are          
      found in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and          
      Jupiter, but those that come within 1.3 AU of the Sun are known         
      as near-Earth asteroids. The orbits of these dynamically young          
      bodies have evolved on 100-million-year timescales because of           
      collisions and gravitational interactions with planets. The             
      present-day orbits of such asteroids do not necessarily indicate        
      where they formed. Some are already in Earth-crossing orbits,           
      and those that are not are highly likely to evolve into one.            
      More than 250 near-Earth asteroids are known, and they appear to        
      typify a broad sample of the main-belt population. Before NEAR,         
      knowledge of the nature of asteroids came from three sources:           
      Earth-based remote sensing, data from the Galileo spacecraft            
      flybys of the two main-belt asteroids 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida,           
      and laboratory analyses of meteorites. Most meteorites are              
      believed to be collisional fragments of asteroids, but they may         
      represent a biased and incomplete sampling of the materials             
      actually found in near-Earth asteroids. Firm links between              
      meteorite types and asteroid types have been difficult to               
      establish [GAFFEYETAL1993A].  The uncommon eucrite (a basaltic          
      achondrite) meteorites have been linked by visible and                  
      near-infrared reflectance measurements to the relatively rare           
      V-type asteroids [MCCORDETAL1970], [BINZEL&XU1993].                     
                                                                              
      However, a major controversy has been whether and how the most          
      common meteorite types (the ordinary chondrites) may be linked          
      to the most common asteroid types (the S-type or stony                  
      asteroids) in the inner part of the asteroid belt                       
      [BELLETAL1989], [GAFFEYETAL1993B]. Galileo and NEAR targets 951         
      Gaspra, 243 Ida, and the 433 Eros are all S-type asteroids.)            
                                                                              
      The S-type asteroids are a diverse class of objects known to            
      contain the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene plus an              
      admixture of iron/nickel metal. Some appear to be fragments of          
      bodies that underwent substantial melting and differentiation.          
      Others may consist of primitive materials like ordinary                 
      chondrites that never underwent melting and that may preserve           
      characteristics of the solid material from which the inner              
      planets accreted.  The Galileo flybys provided the very first           
      high-resolution images of S asteroids, revealing complex                
      surfaces covered by craters, fractures, grooves, and subtle             
      color variations [BELTONETAL1992], [OSTROETAL1990].  Galileo            
      also discovered a satellite at Ida, which is a member of the            
      Koronis family (Eros is not an asteroid family member). The             
      near-infrared spectrum of Gaspra indicates a high olivine               
      abundance such that it is inferred to be a fragment of a                
      differentiated body.  Conversely, Ida and Eros display infrared         
      spectra that may be consistent with a silicate mineralogy like          
      that in ordinary chondrites [CHAPMAN1996],                              
      [MURCHIE&PIETERS1996]. The Galileo instrument complement did not        
      include any capability to measure elemental composition, and            
      debate continues about whether ordinary chondrites are related          
      to S-type asteroids.                                                    
                                                                              
      The NEAR mission spent about a year in orbit around Eros,               
      entering 14 February 2000 and landing at the asteroid surface 12        
      February 2001 from when spacecraft operations were continued            
      until 28 February 2001.  It acquired the first comprehensive,           
      spatially resolved measurements of the geomorphology,                   
      reflectance spectral properties, and shape of an asteroid, and          
      X-ray and gamma-ray spectral measurements of elemental                  
      abundances from orbit and the surface. The ambient magnetic             
      field in the vicinity of the asteroid was also measured.  NEAR          
      orbited Eros at low altitude, as close as about 1 body radius           
      above the surface, for several months so as to allow NEAR's             
      instruments to to acquire their highest spatial resolution              
      measurements. The NEAR data, especially when combined with those        
      from the Galileo flybys, greatly advanced our understanding of          
      S-type asteroids and their possible relationships to meteorites         
      and other small bodies of the solar system.  NEAR also conducted        
      a thorough search for satellites.                                       
                                                                              
    Spacecraft Design                                                         
    =================                                                         
      NEAR was a solar-powered, three-axis-stabilized spacecraft              
      [SANTOETAL1995] with a launch mass, including propellant, of 805        
      kg and a dry mass of 468 kg. The spacecraft was simple and              
      highly redundant. It used X-band telemetry to the NASA deep             
      space network; data rates at Eros were selectable in the range          
      of 2.9 to 8.8 kbps using a 34-m high-efficiency antenna. With a         
      70-m antenna, the data rates from Eros ranged from 17.6 to 26.5         
      kbps.  The command and telemetry systems were fully redundant.          
      Two solid-state recorders were accommodated with a combined             
      memory capacity of 1.6 Gbit.                                            
                                                                              
      Spacecraft attitude was determined using a star camera, a fully         
      redundant inertial measurement unit, and redundant digital Sun          
      sensors. The propulsion sub-system was dual mode (hydrazine was         
      used as fuel for both the monopropellant and bipropellant               
      systems) and included one 450-N bipropellant thruster for large         
      maneuvers, four 21-N thrusters, and seven 3.5-N thrusters for           
      fine velocity control and momentum dumping. Attitude was                
      controlled by a redundant set of four reaction wheels or by the         
      thruster complement to within 1.7 mrad. NEAR's line-of-sight            
      pointing stability was within 20 microrad 1 s, and                      
      postprocessing attitude knowledge was within 130 microrad.              
                                                                              
      Forward and aft aluminum honeycomb decks were connected with            
      eight aluminum honeycomb side panels. Mounted on the outside of         
      the forward deck were a fixed, 1.5-m-dia. X-band high-gain              
      antenna (HGA), four fixed solar panels, and the X-ray solar             
      monitor system.  When the solar panels were fully illuminated,          
      the Sun was in the center of the solar monitor field of view            
      (FOV). No booms were accommodated on the spacecraft. The                
      electronics were mounted on the inside of the forward and aft           
      decks.                                                                  
                                                                              
      NEAR contained six scientific instruments, which are detailed in        
      the next section.                                                       
                                                                              
      1. Multispectral Imager (MSI)                                           
      2. Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIS)                                     
      3. X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS)                                             
      4. Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS)                                         
      5. NEAR Laser Rangefinder (NLR)                                         
      6. Magnetometer (MAG)                                                   
                                                                              
      The MAG was mounted on top of the HGA feed, where it was exposed        
      to the minimum level of spacecraft-generated magnetic fields.           
      The remaining instruments (MSI, NIS, XRS, GRS, and NLR) were all        
      mounted on the outside of the aft deck.  They were on fixed             
      mounts and were co-aligned to view a common boresight direction.        
      The NIS had a scan mirror that allowed it to look 30 degrees            
      forward and 110 degrees aft from the common boresight. Key              
      properties of the mission design permitted the use of this fixed        
      spacecraft geometry. Throughout most of the orbital rendezvous          
      with Eros, the angle between the Sun and the Earth, as seen from        
      the spacecraft, remained less than about 30 degrees. In                 
      addition, the mission aphelion was reached during cruise. Hence,        
      if the solar panels were sufficiently large to sustain NEAR at          
      aphelion, there was sufficient power margin at Eros for the             
      spacecraft to pull its solar panels over 30 deg off full                
      illumination to point the HGA at Earth. Moreover, the rendezvous        
      orbit plane was maintained so that the orbit normal pointed             
      approximately at the Sun.  In this case, as NEAR orbited Eros,          
      it was usually able to roll around the HGA axis so as to keep           
      the instruments pointed at the asteroid while maintaining adequate      
      solar panel illumination. The instruments were usually pointed          
      away from the asteroid when the HGA was used to downlink to             
      Earth. This mode of operation motivated the requirement for             
      on-board data storage. With on-board image compression, NEAR            
      could store more than 1000 images and downlink them within 10           
      hrs at its maximum data rate of 26.5 kbps.                              
                                                                              
      The spacecraft was designed using a distributed architecture,           
      partitioned so that subsystems generally did not share common           
      hardware or software. One major benefit of this approach was            
      that careful design of interfaces allowed development, test, and        
      integration of sub-systems in parallel. In addition, this               
      architecture had a natural advantage of built-in contingencies          
      and design margins.  Truly parallel subsystem development               
      required independence at the subsystem interface, through               
      careful partitioning of functional requirements and ample design        
      margins at subsystem inter-faces. On NEAR, subsystems were              
      interfaced through a MIL-STD-1553 data bus, chosen because it           
      was compatible with many off-the-shelf industry components. The         
      data bus had additional attractive features: fewer                      
      interconnecting cables; built-in redundancy and cross-strapping;        
      simplification of interface definition; a fault-tolerant,               
      transformer-coupled interface; a common data architecture for           
      sharing information among subsystems; and a flexible                    
      software-defined interface instead of a rigid hardware-defined          
      interface.                                                              
                                                                              
      When it was launched, NEAR was the lowest-cost U.S. planetary           
      mission ever. The spacecraft's 27-month development schedule was        
      unusually rapid. The distributed architecture and the selection         
      of the 1553 data bus were key to developing NEAR on time and            
      under budget. Previous planetary missions have not used a               
      distributed architecture because they have been optimized for           
      performance, i.e., to return maximum science within available           
      technology. The distributed architecture approach comes with a          
      mass penalty, and therefore a performance penalty: some hardware        
      that can be combined at the system level is duplicated at the           
      subsystem level. The distributed architecture approach for NEAR         
      features interface margin and testability, optimizing the               
      spacecraft for low cost and rapid schedule. Nevertheless, the           
      performance penalty is minuscule, and the mass penalty for using        
      the distributed architecture approach is only about 10 kg.

        The main goals of the MSI were to determine the shape of Eros         
        and to map the mineralogy and morphology of features on its           
        surface at high spatial resolution. MSI was a 537 x 244 pixel         
        charge-coupled device camera with five-element                        
        radiation-hardened refractive optics. It covered the spectral         
        range from 0.4 to 1.1 microns, and it had an eight-position           
        filter wheel. Seven narrow-band filters were chosen to                
        discriminate the major iron-bearing silicates present (olivine        
        and pyroxene); the eight, broad-band filter was for fast              
        exposures and high sensitivity, including optical navigation.         
        occur on Eros. The camera had an FOV of 2.93 x 2.26 degrees           
        and a pixel resolution of 96 x 162 microrad. It had a maximum         
        framing rate of 1 per second with images digitized to 12 bits         
        and a dedicated digital processing unit with an image buffer          
        in addition to both lossless and lossy on-board image                 
        compression.                                                          
                                                                              
      Near-Infrared Spectrograph                                              
      --------------------------                                              
        NIS measured the spectrum of sunlight reflected from Eros in          
        the near-infrared range from 0.8 to 2.5 microns to determine          
        the distribution and abundance of surface minerals like               
        olivine and pyroxene.  This grating spectrometer dispersed the        
        light from the slit FOV (0.38 x 0.76 degrees in its narrow            
        position and 0.76 x 0.76 degrees in the wide position) across         
        a pair of passively cooled one-dimensional array detectors. A         
        32-channel germanium array covering the lower wavelengths,            
        with channel centers at 0.82 to 1.49 microns with a 0.022             
        micron spacing between channels. A 32-channel indium/gallium-         
        arsenide array covering longer wavelengths, with channel              
        centers at 1.37 to 2.71 microns with a 0.043 micron spacing           
        between channels. Due to configuration of the optics and the          
        sensitivity of this array, useful measurements were acquired          
        by it over the wavelength range 1.5 to 2.5 microns.  The slit         
        could be closed for dark current measurements, which were             
        routinely interleaved with measurements of the asteroid. NIS          
        had a scan mirror that enabled it to step across the range            
        from 30 degrees forward of the common boresight to 110 degrees        
        aft, in 0.4 degree steps. Spectral images were built up by a          
        combination of scan mirror and spacecraft motions. In                 
        addition, the NIS had a gold calibration target that viewed at        
        the forward limit of the mirror's scan ranges. It scattered           
        sunlight into the instrument and provided a quantitative,             
        in-flight calibration of instrument stability.                        
                                                                              
      X-Ray Spectrometer                                                      
      ------------------                                                      
        The XRS was an X-ray resonance fluorescence spectrometer that         
        detected the characteristic X-ray line emissions excited by           
        solar X-rays from major elements in the asteroid's surface. It        
        covered X-rays in the energy range from 1 to 10 keV using             
        three gas proportional counters.  The balanced, differential          
        filter technique was used to separate the closely spaced Mg,          
        Al, and Si lines lying below 2 keV. The gas proportional              
        counters directly resolved higher energy line emissions from          
        Ca and Fe.                                                            
                                                                              
        A mechanical collimator gave the XRS a 5 degree FOV, with             
        which it mapped the chemical composition of the asteroid at           
        spatial resolutions as fine as 2 km in the low orbits. It also        
        included a separate solar monitor system to measure                   
        continuously the incident spectrum of solar X-rays, using both        
        a gas proportional counter and a high-spectral-resolution             
        silicon X-ray detector. The XRS performed in-flight                   
        calibration using a calibration rod with Fe-55 sources that           
        could be rotated into or out of the detector FOV.                     
                                                                              
      Gamma-Ray Spectrometer                                                  
      ----------------------                                                  
        The GRS detected characteristic gamma rays in the 0.3- to             
        10-MeV range emitted from specific elements in the asteroid           
        surface. Some of these emissions were excited by cosmic rays          
        and some arose from natural radioactivity in the asteroid. The        
        GRS used a body-mounted, passively cooled NaI scintillator            
        detector with a bismuth germanate anticoincidence shield that         
        defined a 45 degree FOV.  Abundances of several important             
        elements such as K, Si, and Fe were measured.                         
                                                                              
      NEAR Laser Rangefinder

        The NLR was a laser altimeter that measured the distance from         
        the spacecraft to the asteroid surface by sending out a short         
        burst of laser light and then recording the time required for         
        the signal to return from the asteroid. It used a                     
        chromium-doped neodymium/yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Cr-Nd-YAG)          
        solid-state laser and a compact reflecting telescope. It sent         
        a small portion of each emitted laser pulse through an optical        
        fiber of known length and into the receiver, providing a              
        continuous in-flight calibration of the timing circuit.  The          
        ranging data were used to construct a global shape model and a        
        global topographic map of Eros with horizontal resolution of          
        about 300 m. The NLR also measured detailed topographic               
        profiles of surface features on Eros with a best spatial              
        resolution of under 5 m. These topographic profiles enhanced          
        and complemented the study of surface morphology from imaging.        
                                                                              
      Magnetometer                                                            
      ------------                                                            
        The fluxgate magnetometer used ring core sensors made of              
        highly magnetically permeable material. MAG searched for any          
        intrinsic magnetic fields of Eros. The recent Galileo flybys          
        of the S-type asteroids Gaspra and Ida yielded evidence that          
        both of these bodies are magnetic, although this evidence is          
        ambiguous [KIVELSONETAL1993]. Discovery of an intrinsic               
        magnetic field at Eros would have been the first definitive           
        detection of magnetism at an asteroid and would have yielded          
        important insights about its thermal and geological history.

        In addition to the six major instruments, a coherent X-band           
        transponder was used to conduct a radio science investigation         
        by measuring the Doppler shift from the spacecraft's radial           
        velocity component relative to the Earth.  Accurate                   
        measurements of the Doppler shift and the range to Earth as           
        the spacecraft orbited Eros allowed mapping of the asteroid's         
        gravity field. In conjunction with MSI/NIS and NLR data,              
        gravity determinations were combined with global shape and            
        rotation data to constrain the internal density structure of          
        Eros and search for heterogeneity.

      ===============                                                         
        The NEAR spacecraft was successfully launched in February             
        1996, taking advantage of the unique alignment of Earth and           
        Eros that occurs only once every 7 years [FARQUHARETAL1995].          
        A Delta-II 7925 rocket placed NEAR into a 2-year DV                   
        (trajectory correction maneuver)/Earth gravity-assist                 
        trajectory (DVEGA). This trajectory represents a new                  
        application of the DVEGA technique: Instead of using an Earth         
        swingby maneuver to increase the aphelion of the spacecraft           
        trajectory, the maneuver actually decreased the aphelion              
        distance while increasing the inclination from 0 to about 10          
        deg.  The circuitous 3-year flight path to Eros was the result        
        of a Discovery Program requirement to use an inexpensive, but         
        less capable, launch vehicle. With a larger launch vehicle            
        such as an Atlas or Titan, a 1-year direct trajectory could           
        have been used, but the total mission cost would have                 
        increased by at least $50 million.                                    
                                                                              
        The Mathilde encounter occurred 1 week before the deep space          
        maneuver on 3 July 1997. The Earth swingby occurred on 23             
        January 1998. Rendezvous operations at Eros were scheduled to         
        begin on 20 December 1998, but a main rocket engine abort             
        occurred. A flyby of Eros was accomplished on 23 December             
        1998, and the rendezvous was rescheduled for 14 February 2000,        
        when orbit insertion occurred.  On 12 February 2001, NEAR             
        accomplished a soft landing on Eros.

      --------------                                                          
        Asteroid 253 Mathilde was discovered on 12 November 1885 by           
        Johann Palisa in Vienna, Austria. The name was suggested by V.        
        A. Lebeuf (1859-1929), a staff member of the Paris                    
        Observatory, who first computed an orbit for the new asteroid.        
        The name is thought to honor the wife of astronomer Moritz            
        Loewy (1833-1907), then the vice director of the Paris                
        Observatory. Although Mathilde's existence has been known             
        since 1885, it was only following the announcement of NEAR's          
        possible flyby that extensive physical observations were              
        carried out using telescopes on Earth. These showed that              
        Mathilde was an unusual object, especially because of its             
        rotation, which is at least an order of magnitude slower than         
        typical main-belt asteroids.                                          
                                                                              
        Using a series of observations of this asteroid made in the           
        first half of 1995, Stefano Mottola and his colleagues                
        [MOTTOLAETAL1995] determined that Mathilde's rotation period          
        is an extremely long 17.4 days.  Only two asteroids, 288              
        Glauke and 1220 Clocus, have longer periods (48 and 31 days,          
        respectively), and there is no obvious mechanism that can             
        account for these extremely long asteroid 'days.'                     
                                                                              
        The only previous spacecraft encounters with asteroids, as            
        noted earlier, had been the Galileo flybys of 951 Gaspra in           
        October 1991 and 243 Ida in August 1993. Both of these                
        objects, as well as Eros, are S-type asteroids. However, the          
        most common type of asteroid in the outer asteroid belt, the          
        dark and primitive C-type objects, had not yet been                   
        investigated.                                                         
                                                                              
        Spectral observations of Mathilde showed that its spectrum was        
        consistent with those of C-type asteroids and that it was             
        similar to those of the large carbonaceous asteroids 1 Ceres          
        and 2 Pallas (the two largest asteroids).  (Mathilde is about         
        twice the size of Ida and four times the size of Gaspra.)             
        Before the NEAR spacecraft executed its flyby of Mathilde on          
        27 June 1997, these additional facts were known about the             
        asteroid: estimated diameter, 61 km; H magnitude (a measure of        
        absolute visual brightness), 10.30; perihelion, 1.94 AU;              
        aphelion, 3.35 AU; and orbital inclination, 6.71 degrees.             
                                                                              
        Prior to the NEAR spacecraft encounter with Mathilde, on              
        27 June 1997 Mission Operations sent a command to the NEAR            
        spacecraft that had the effect of advancing the Mission               
        Elapsed Time (MET) clock by 10 seconds. This command was              
        issued in order to correct for a timing error in the Mathilde         
        fly-by observing sequence due to ephemeris uncertainties which        
        existed at the time the sequence was generated and loaded to          
        the spacecraft. After analysis of the final optical navigation        
        data, the navigation team determined an additional shift              
        decrementing the MET clock by 1 second was necessary. Mission         
        Operations sent the additional command to the spacecraft; thus        
        collectively these commands had the effect of incrementing the        
        MET clock on board the NEAR spacecraft by 9 seconds. The NEAR         
        spacecraft fly-by of Mathilde was then successfully executed.         
        Following the Mathilde fly-by Mission Operations commanded the        
        spacecraft to restore the MET clock.                                  
                                                                              
        NEAR's encounter with Mathilde occurred at about 2 AU from the        
        Sun, where available power from the solar panels was reduced          
        to about 25% of its maximum mission level. Furthermore, a             
        requirement to point the solar panels about 50 deg away from          
        the optimal solar direction during the encounter reduced the          
        available power by another 36%. Because of this power                 
        constraint, the only science instrument operated during the           
        encounter period was MSI [LANDSHOF&CHENG1995]. However,               
        spacecraft tracking data for the radio science experiment were        
        obtained for an asteroid mass determination [CHENGETAL1994].          
                                                                              
        The imaging experiment during the flyby had three major               
        objectives:                                                           
                                                                              
        1. Most importantly, to obtain at least one image of Mathilde         
        near closest approach to provide the                                  
        highest-spatial-resolution view of the surface                        
                                                                              
        2. To obtain an image of the complete illuminated portion of          
        the asteroid visible during the flyby                                 
                                                                              
        3. To acquire images of the sky around the asteroid to search         
        for possible satellites                                               
                                                                              
        The entire imaging sequence was accomplished in about 25 min          
        around closest approach (1200 km) at a speed of 9.93 km/s (Sun        
        distance, 1.99 AU; Earth distance, 2.19 AU). A total of 534           
        images (24 high phase angle, 144 high-resolution, 188 global          
        color imaging, 178 satellite search) were obtained during this        
        interval. The whole illuminated portion of the asteroid was           
        imaged in color at about a 500 m/pixel at a phase angle near          
        40 degrees. The best partial views were at 200 to 350 m/pixel.        
                                                                              
        Mathilde's mass was determined by accurately tracking NEAR            
        before and after the encounter. Apart from an interval of 1 to        
        2 h during the closest approach period, when imaging                  
        experiments were conducted, continuous tracking of the                
        spacecraft was conducted for 3 days on either side of closest         
        approach.  During the flyby, Mathilde exerted a slight                
        gravitational tug on NEAR. The corresponding gravitational            
        tugs on the Galileo spacecraft at Gaspra and Ida were too             
        small to allow mass determinations.  However, because                 
        Mathilde's mass is so much larger than either Gaspra's or             
        Ida's, its effects on NEAR's path were detectable in the              
        spacecraft's radio tracking data.                                     
                                                                              
      Earth Swingby                                                           
      -------------                                                           
      The next critical phase of NEAR's                                       
      flight profile was scheduled for 23 January 1998, when the              
      spacecraft would pass by the Earth at an altitude of only 532           
      km. This maneuver was expected to drastically alter NEAR's              
      heliocentric trajectory, changing the inclination from 0.52 to          
      10.04 deg, and reducing the aphelion distance from 2.18 to 1.77         
      AU and perihelion distance from 0.95 to 0.98 AU.  An interesting        
      consequence of the Earth flyby was that the post-swingby                
      trajectory remained over the Earth's south polar region for a           
      considerable time.                                                      
                                                                              
        During the encounter MSI and NIS observations of both Earth           
        and the Moon were acquired from 23 January through 26 January,        
        to test instrument performance during extended operations like        
        at Eros, and to perform inflight radiance and alignment               
        calibrations.                                                         
                                                                              
      Eros Encounter                                                          
      --------------                                                          
      The NEAR mission target, 433 Eros,                                      
      is the second largest asteroid and is intermediate in size              
      between Gaspra and Ida. Eros is one of only three near-Earth            
      asteroids with maximum diameter above 10 km, and it is the only         
      large one whose heliocentric orbit is accessible enough to              
      permit a rendezvous mission using the Delta II launch vehicle.          
      The mean diameter of Eros, about 17 km, is an order of magnitude        
      larger than that of typical known near-Earth asteroids.  Eros           
      was discovered in 1898. It was the subject of a worldwide               
      ground-based observing campaign in 1975 when it passed within           
      0.15 AU of Earth.  Visible, infrared, and radar observations            
      determined the approximate size, shape, rotation rate, and pole         
      position of Eros (Table 1) and showed that a regolith                   
      (fragmentary material produced by impacts) was present on its           
      surface. 433 Eros is presently in a Mars-crossing (but not              
      Earth-crossing) orbit; however, numerical simulations suggest           
      that it may evolve into an Earth crosser within 2 million years.        
      [MICHELETAL1996]                                                        
                                                                              
        Spectroscopic analyses have found the visible and                     
        near-infrared spectra of Eros to be consistent with a silicate        
        mineralogy like that found in ordinary chondrite meteorites.          
        These measurements were extended to higher spatial resolution         
        by NEAR.                                                              
                                                                              
        Rendezvous operations at Eros were scheduled to begin on 20           
        December 1998, culminating in orbit insertion on 10 January.          
        During the first of four main rocket engine firings to match          
        velocity with Eros, on 20 December, an abort occurred and NEAR        
        flew by Eros on 23 December at a relative velocity of 1 km/s.         
        At this time a contingency sequence was executed during which         
        data were collected by MSI, NIS, and MAG. The whole                   
        illuminated portion of the asteroid was imaged in color at            
        about 500 m/pixel before and after closest approach at phase          
        angles of 80 to 110 degrees. The best partial views were at           
        about 400 m/pixel.                                                    
                                                                              
    Eros Operations                                                           
    ===============                                                           
                                                                              
        Beginning in January 2000, a sequence of small maneuvers              
        decreased the relative velocity between NEAR and Eros to only         
        5 m/s. On 13 Feb 2000, NEAR performed a flyby of Eros on its          
        sunward side at a distance as of 200 km. In addition to               
        gathering NIS spectra at an optimal illumination geometry,            
        this first pass provided improved estimates of the asteroid's         
        physical parameters, such as a mass determination to 1%               
        accuracy, identification of surface landmarks, and an improved        
        estimate of Eros's spin vector. Orbit insertion occurred 14           
        Feb. As the spacecraft orbiter altitude was subsequently              
        lowered, the mass, moments of inertia, gravity harmonics, spin        
        state, and landmark locations were determined with increasing         
        precision.                                                            
                                                                              
        NEAR operated in a series of orbits that came as close as 3 km        
        to the asteroid's surface, culminating with a soft landing on         
        12 February 2001. The evolution of low-altitude orbits around         
        Eros was strongly influenced by its irregular gravity field.          
        In unstable orbits, the spacecraft could crash into Eros in a         
        matter of days. Safe operation of NEAR during its 11-month            
        prime science phase required close coordination between the           
        science, mission design, navigation, and mission operations           
        teams.  [LANDSHOF&CHENG1995]                                          
                                                                              
        To simplify science operations, the rendezvous was divided            
        into distinct phases [CHENGETAL1994]. During each mission             
        phase, particular aspects of the science were emphasized for          
        science planning, so the highest priority investigation               
        controlled instrument pointing for the majority of the                
        observing time. The highest-priority science varied by mission        
        phase, because of the changing orbital geometry.  While in            
        orbits at 100 km or more from the center of Eros, the highest         
        priority science was global mapping by MSI. In orbits at 50 km        
        or lower, the highest priority science was compositional              
        measurement by XRS/GRS. A two-week period was allocated to            
        altimetry by NLR at the start of the 50 km polar orbits. NEAR         
        spent more than 150 days in orbits at 50 km or less from the          
        center of Eros, plus two additional  weeks on the surface             
        acquiring GRS data.

        All data from the NEAR mission were down-linked to the NASA           
        Deep Space Network and then forwarded to the Mission                  
        Operations Center (MOC) at APL.  Doppler and ranging data from        
        the spacecraft were analyzed primarily by the NEAR navigation         
        team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and processed to          
        determine the spacecraft ephemeris as well as to perform radio        
        science investigations. The entire spacecraft telemetry               
        stream, including spacecraft and instrument housekeeping data         
        and all science data, was forwarded to the APL MOC together           
        with the radiometric Doppler and range data. Navigation data          
        including spacecraft Ephemeris were forwarded to MOC in the           
        form of SPICE kernels.  (SPICE is an information system               
        developed by the Navigation Ancillary Information Facility at         
        JPL.  It consists of data files and software for managing             
        navigation-related data including spacecraft and planetary            
        ephemerides, spacecraft pointing, timekeeping, gravity data,          
        etc.)                                                                 
                                                                              
        From the APL MOC the spacecraft telemetry stream were passed          
        to the Science Data Center (SDC), the project facility                
        responsible for low-level processing of spacecraft telemetry,         
        data distribution, and data archiving. As such, the SDC               
        supported the activities of the science team in data analysis         
        and mission planning. The SDC created and maintained an               
        archive, which was the central project repository for science         
        data products such as images, asteroid models, and asteroid           
        maps. The SDC enabled easy access to mission data sets by             
        members of the science team and by others, and it collected           
        observing requests and science priorities from the science            
        team. It maintained a telemetry archive, a record of                  
        instrument and spacecraft commands as executed, and records of        
        science sequences as requested and as executed.  It provided          
        ancillary data (spacecraft and planetary ephemerides,                 
        spacecraft and planetary attitudes, shape and gravity files,          
        and spacecraft clock files) in the form of SPICE kernels to           
        the science team.                                                     
                                                                              
    Conclusion                                                                
    ==========                                                                
                                                                              
    NEAR substantially increased our knowledge                                
    of primitive bodies in the solar system by providing a long,              
    up-close look at the S-type asteroid 433 Eros and the first               
    resolved images of the C-type asteroid 253 Mathilde. NEAR was the         
    first mission to a near-Earth asteroid and a C-type asteroid, and         
    it was the first spacecraft to flyby, orbit, and land on a small          
    body."                                                                    
                                                                              
    MISSION_OBJECTIVES_SUMMARY     = "                                        
                                                                              
    Science Objectives                                                        
    ==================                                                        
                                                                              
        The overall objectives of the NEAR mission are to rendezvous          
        with a near-Earth asteroid, achieve orbit around such an              
        asteroid, and conduct the first systematic scientific                 
        exploration of a near-Earth asteroid. NEAR studied the nature         
        and evolution of S-type asteroids, improved our understanding         
        of processes and conditions relevant to the formation of              
        planets in the early solar system, and clarified the                  
        relationship between asteroids and meteorites.                        
                                                                              
        Specific science questions addressed by NEAR are as follows.          
        What are the morphological and textural characteristics of the        
        asteroid surface, and how do they compare with those on larger        
        bodies? What is the elemental and mineralogical composition of        
        the asteroid? Is there evidence of compositional or structural        
        heterogeneity? Is the asteroid a solid fragment of a larger           
        parent body or a rubble pile? Is the asteroid's precursor             
        body(ies) primitive or differentiated? Is there evidence of           
        past or present cometary activity? Is the asteroid related to         
        a meteorite type or types? Does an intrinsic magnetic field           
        exist? What is it like?  Does the asteroid have any                   
        satellites, and how might they compare with Eros?"
