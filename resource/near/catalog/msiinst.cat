The Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) on the Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous         
(NEAR) spacecraft uses a five-element refractive optical telescope,           
has a field of view of 2.93 x 2.25 degrees, a focal length of 167.35          
mm, and has a spatial resolution of 16.1 x 9.5 m at a range of 100 km.        
The spectral sensitivity of the instrument spans visible to near              
infrared wavelengths, and was designed to provide insight into the            
nature and fundamental properties of asteroids and comets.  Seven             
narrow-band spectral filters were chosen to provide multicolor imaging        
and to make comparative studies with previous observations of S               
asteroids and measurements of the characteristic absorption in Fe             
minerals near 1 micron.  An eighth filter with a much wider spectral          
passband will be used for optical navigation and    for imaging faint         
objects, down to visual magnitude of +10.5.  The camera has a                 
fixed 1 Hz frame rate and the signal intensities are digitized                
to 12 bits.  The detector, a Thomson-CSF TH7866A                              
Charge-Coupled Device, permits electronic shuttering which                    
effectively varies the dynamic range over an additional three orders          
of magnitude.  Communication with the NEAR spacecraft occurs via a            
MIL-STD-1553 bus interface, and a high speed serial interface                 
permits rapid transmission of images to the spacecraft solid state            
recorder.  On-board image processing consists of a multi-tiered data          
compression scheme.  The instrument was extensively tested and                
calibrated prior to launch; some inflight calibrations have already           
been completed.  For a detailed overview of the Multi-Spectral                
Imager and its objectives, design, construction, testing and                  
calibration, see [HAWKINSETAL1997]  Space         Science Reviews 82,         
31-100.  The text in this data set catalog object    has been                 
extracted from this paper.                                                    
                                                                              
Two major subassemblies make up the MSI instrument:  a camera and a           
Data Processing Unit, or DPU.  These two assemblies are physically            
separated by about 100 mm and are located on the aft deck of the              
NEAR spacecraft, with the camera's optical axis parallel to the               
X'-axis of the spacecraft.  A refractive optical telescope, a filter          
wheel, and a detector with its associated electronics are all part            
of the camera.  The DPU provides a digital interface to the                   
spacecraft and supplies power and the master timing to the camera.

=============================                                                 
The MSI Data Processing Unit (DPU) provides the necessary digital             
interface to the camera's FPD, and houses all of MSI's power                  
converters, filter wheel control electronics, and the master clocking         
required by the camera.  A microprocessor within the DPU receives             
commands from one of the two redundant spacecraft Command Telemetry           
Processors (CTPs).  The CTP distributes commands, collects    data            
from all instruments, and formats the data for recording and                  
downlinking.  Communication with the spacecraft takes place via a             
MIL-STD-1553 bus or alternatively through a high speed serial link            
(2 Mbits/s).  Eight image buffers within the DPU allow temporary              
storage of the image data, permitting a variety of data compression           
algorithms to be applied to the data. Implementation of a                     
multi-tiered compression scheme allows any algorithm to be applied            
to the data individually, or in combination.  Both lossy and                  
lossless compression algorithms are available.  Images acquired and           
digitized by the camera are transferred to the DPU in parallel                
through a short harness.                                                      
                                                                              
A 1 Hz timing signal from the spacecraft synchronizes commands from           
the DPU to the camera.  Integration times may be commanded from 1 to          
999 ms, effectively varying the sensitivity of the instrument by              
nearly three orders of magnitude.  Each full image is made up of 244          
x 537 pixels and contains a header of all the parameters associated           
with the image, including the time the image was taken, CCD                   
temperature, exposure time, filter, data compression information,             
etc.  The data are packetized within the DPU. In addition to the              
image data, each packet also includes information to locate its data          
within the overall image.  This design minimizes data loss in the             
event of a single lost or corrupted packet."
