        This data set contains the Peter Thomas shape model for               
        asteroid 433 Eros, based on optical data from the NEAR                
        MSI instrument.  The current version of this data set contains        
        the following shape model files and PRODUCT_ID's

        Each shape model file also has a detached label file, with a          
        suffix of .lbl, which describes the respective formats.               
                                                                              
        The first six files are in a plate model format and only              
        represent the model shape.  The last file is in a modified            
        Peter Thomas RGST model format and includes shape, gravity,           
        slope and topograpic information.                                     
                                                                              
        N.B.:  In the RGST-EROS-2001012 product, some radii starting from     
        the model center intersect the surface in more than one point.        
        This happens mostly around 160 degrees west longitude.  That means    
        that the RGST format used in that product is not able to adequately   
        represent the shape model's surface.  Caveat emptor.  If this is an   
        issue, users may use one of the plate models.                         
                                                                              
        The plate file naming convention uses three fields, separated by      
        underscores:  the first field is the target, eros; the second         
        field represents the version of the base shape model, 2001012;        
        the third field gives the number of plates in that file's             
        representation of the base shape model.                               
                                                                              
        All files represent the same Eros shape model (2001012)               
        only the resolution and format changes between files.                 
                                                                              
        These shape models are distinct from the Peter Thomas shape           
        models based on optical data from other sources, included             
        in a separate data set:  EAR-A-5-DDR-SHAPE-MODELS-V2.0.               
                                                                              
        These shape models are also distinct from the shape models            
        based on radar observations, included in a separate                   
        data set:  EAR-A-5-DDR-RADARSHAPE-MODELS-V1.0.

        The body-fixed ``Planetocentric'' coordinate system referred to       
        here is defined for solar system bodies as follows:                   
                                                                              
         --   The x-axis of the Planetocentric coordinate system for a        
              specified body lies both in the body's equatorial plane and     
              in the plane containing the body's prime meridian.              
                                                                              
         --   The z-axis is parallel to the body's mean axis of rotation      
              and points North of the invariable plane of the solar system    
              (regardless of the body's spin direction). The north pole is    
              this pole of rotation.                                          
                                                                              
         --   The y-axis is defined as the cross product of the z and x       
              axes, in that order. Thus, the frame is right-handed.           
                                                                              
        The above definition implies that the axes of a planetocentric        
        system are time-varying. Thus a complete specification of the         
        axes requires identification of an epoch as well as the body.         
        This frame is relative to J2000.

        The plate model format is compatible with software developed

        Joseph, which is used to collect and solve for the control            
        points that are the basis for the shape model, and ORBIT,             
        written by Brian Carcich, which used the model to aid science         
        planners when they created the sequences of images during             
        the NEAR mission.  None of these software packages will               
        be archived with these shape models.
