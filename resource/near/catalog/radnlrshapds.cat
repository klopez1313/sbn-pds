    This file contains a shape model for the                                  
    asteroid Eros derived from NEAR Laser Rangefinder observations.           
    The NLR measurements were made over the period 30 April 2000 to           
    27 August 2000 from orbits of 35 and 50 km.                               
                                                                              
    The gravity model obtained by integrating this shape model is             
    provided as a separate companion file ('gr_101.dat') to this file.        
                                                                              
    The shape model files and descriptive information regarding the file      
    formats and contents were kindly supplied by J.K. Miller of the NEAR      
    navigation team, in response to user requests made at the NEAR PDS

    ==========                                                                
                                                                              
    SH_101.DAT    A multi-part table giving X, Y, and Z vertices of the       
                    shape model, the plate model, and parameters.             
                                                                              
    The shape table lists a serial number and coordinates for                 
    each vertex comprising the plate model of the shape of Eros. The          
    vertex numbers are referenced in the following table.                     
                                                                              
    NOTE that the first row of this table contains only a single              
    integer in the first column, giving the total number of vertices          
    in the table.                                                             
                                                                              
    The index number of the vertex. This number is used in the plate table.   
                                                                              
    Following rows contain (x,y,z) position of the vertex                     
                                                                              
    The shape table further defines the triangular plates comprising          
    the Eros shape model. For each plate three vertices are listed by         
    vertex number. The positions corresponding to each vertex number          
    are defined in the preceeding vertex table.                               
                                                                              
    NOTE: The first row of this table contains only a single integer          
          indicating the total number of plates defined.                      
                                                                              
    Subsequent rows have the index number for the triangular plate defined    
    along with the index numbers of the three vertices defining this plate    
                                                                              
    Then there is a single-row table contains two constants relating          
    to the table of harmonic coefficients:                                    
    first the degree of the harmonic solution. The total number               
    of coefficients in the solution is (NDEGREE+1)^2.                         
    Second there is a Normalization flag. This value is '1', indicating       
    that the following solution has been fully normalized.                    
                                                                              
    The last part of the table lists several parameters and the harmonic      
    coefficients constituting the shape model solution. The format, an        
    in-house format used by the NAV team, is not tied to logical records,     
    but rather makes use of a repeating, 3-column physical record structure   
    as needed to hold the various parameters. The contents of the rows of     
    the table are as follows:                                                 
                                                                              
    The first two records contain the volume of the model and the vector      
    offset from the center of the shape model to the true center of           
    gravity:                                                                  
                                                                              
      Record 1:                                                               
        Column 1   Volume in km^3                                             
        Column 2   -blank-                                                    
        Column 3   -blank-                                                    
                                                                              
      Record 2:                                                               
        Column 1   Xcg  in km                                                 
        Column 2   Ycg  in km                                                 
        Column 3   Zcg  in km                                                 
                                                                              
    The next two record contain the coefficients for the inertia tensor.      
    Note that this is a symmetric matrix, so only the unique elements are     
    specified here:                                                           
                                                                              
      Record 3:                                                               
        Column 1   Ixx  in km^2                                               
        Column 2   Iyy  in km^2                                               
        Column 3   Izz  in km^2                                               
                                                                              
      Record 4:                                                               
        Column 1   Ixy  in km^2                                               
        Column 2   Ixz  in km^2                                               
        Column 3   Iyz  in km^2                                               
                                                                              
    The subsequent records contain the shape model harmonic coefficients      
    Cij and Sij. All the Si0 are = 0, and are thus omitted from this file.    
    The remaining coefficients are stored three to a record, in this          
    logical sequence:

    which becomes this physical sequence:

    The total number of coefficients stored is (NDEGREE+1)^2, where           
    NDEGREE is found as the first integer (i.e., COLUMN 1) in the first       
    row of the HDR_TABLE, above,

    GR_101.DAT  ASCII coefficients for the gravity model.                     
                                                                              
    The gravity model table starts as one row with three integer parameters:  
    The degree of the harmonic solution presented and two processing flags.   
    The degree of the harmonic solution, i.e., the number of harmonic         
    cooefficient stored in this file is (NDEGREE+1)^2.                        
    The first flag indicating that the result has been normalized.            
    It is equal to '1'.  A second flag as an internal processing flag,        
    equal to '1'                                                              
                                                                              
    Next this table lists the various parameters and harmonic                 
    coefficients of the gravity solution. The format, an in-house format      
    used by the NAV team, is not based on logical records, but rather         
    makes use of a repeating, 3-number physical record structure as           
    needed to hold the various parameters. The contents of the rows of        
    the table are as follows.                                                 
                                                                              
    The first two records contain general model parameters:                   
                                                                              
      Record 1:                                                               
        Column 1   Volume in km^3 of the model

        Column 3   Mass in kg

        Column 1   The gravitational potential, GM, in km^2/s^3               
        Column 2   R0, the average radius used in the model - in this case    
                   selected to be the maximum radius                          
        Column 3   -blank-                                                    
                                                                              
    The next two records contain the coefficients for the inertia tensor.     
    Note that this is a symmetric matrix, so only the unique elements are     
    specified here:

    The subsequent records contain the gravitational harmonic coefficients    
    Cij and Sij. All the Si0 are = 0, and are thus omitted from this file.    
    The remaining coefficients are stored three to a record, in this

    The shape model include both a triangular plate model and a set           
    of spherical harmonics. The plate model is comprised of two lists:        
    a list of (x,y,z) vertex positions relative to the center of the          
    model; and a list of the triples of vertices defining each of the         
    triangular plate.                                                         
                                                                              
    The spherical harmonics are provided as a set of coefficients             
    with corresponding values for volume, center-of-gravity offset            
    and the inertia tensor.
