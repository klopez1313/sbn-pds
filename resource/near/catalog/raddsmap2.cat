    In the simple cylindrical projection [SNYDER1987], parallels              
    of latitude and meridians of longitude are straight lines that            
    intersect one another at right angles.                                    
                                                                              
    Images in this projection are centered on the equator. Map                
    resolution is constant throughout the image, thus increasing              
    distortion away from the poles.                                           
                                                                              
    The transformation from latitude and longitude (LAT, LON) in              
    degrees to LINE and SAMPLE is given by the following equations.

    In the above definitions, integral values of LINE and SAMPLE              
    correspond to the center of a pixel, and the top left image               
    pixel has LINE=1 and SAMPLE=1. LAT and LON are the latitude and           
    longitude of a given spot on the surface in degrees.

      is the image line number minus one on which the map projection          
      origin occurs.  The map projection origin is the intersection           
      of the equator and the projection longitude CENTER_LONGITUDE.

      is the value of the projection latitude in degrees, which is            
      typically the latitude that passes through the center of the            
      projection.

      is the value of the projection longitude in degrees, which is           
      typically the longitude that passes through the center of the           
      projection.

      number of pixels per degree at the projection origin.                   
                                                                              
    The following four keywords are defined in the PDS Data                   
    Dictionary, but their usage in Mars Global Surveyor Radio Science         
    image products may be non-standard.  In more conventional usage           
    these keywords define the limits of the area covered by the image         
    or map.  In Radio Science products, their values are the extremes         
    at the pixel centers.
