      of Eros are presented in a Simple Cylindrical map projection. In        
      this projection, parallels of latitude and longitude are                
      straight lines with constant distances between equal latitude and       
      longitude intervals. This projection offers a number of advantages      
      for storing and managing global digital data; in particular, it is      
      computationally simple, and data are stored in a compact form.          
      Distortion in the projection is greatest at the poles were the          
      pole becomes a complete line rather than a point on the surface.        
                                                                              
      The transformation from latitude and longitude to line and              
      sample is given by the following equations:

      Note that integral values of line and sample correspond to the          
      center of a pixel. Lat and lon are the latitude and longitude           
      of a given location on the surface.                                     
                                                                              
      LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is the line number minus one on which            
      the map projection origin occurs. The map projection origin             
      is the intersection of the equator and the projection                   
      longitude. The value of LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is positive for          
      images starting north of the equator and is negative for images         
      starting south of the equator.                                          
                                                                              
      SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is the nearest sample number to the            
      left of the projection longitude. The value of SAMPLE_                  
      PROJECTION_OFFSET is positive for images starting to the west           
      of the projection longitude and is negative for images starting         
      to the east of the projection longitude.                                
                                                                              
      MAP_RESOLUTION is measured in pixels/degree.                            
                                                                              
      There are four PDS parameters that specify the latitude and             
      longitude boundaries of an image.  MAXIMUM_LATITUDE and                 
      MINIMUM_LATITUDE specify the latitude boundaries of the image,          
      and EASTERNMOST_LONGITUDE and WESTERNMOST_LONGITUDE specify the         
      longitudinal boundaries of the map.
