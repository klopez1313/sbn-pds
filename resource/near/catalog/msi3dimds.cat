      The PRODUCT_ID uses the same convention without the '.IMG' suffix,      
      and may use hyphens instead of underscores.                             
                                                                              
      Each DIM has an attached label; each filename has a suffix              
      of .IMG which identifies it as a standard PDS image file.               
                                                                              
      The DIM file naming convention uses five numeric fields,                
      delimited by a letter F first, then two underscores or                  
      hyphens in the filename or the PRODUCT_ID, respectively,                
      and finally by one of the letters N or S, which itself                  
      qualifies the fourth numeric field.  The following table                
      lists the numeric fields and the delimiters, and gives their            
      lengths in characters and their meanings:

        Each DIM file's data are an image representation of                   
        normal reflectance at 0 degrees emission angle and                    
        30 degrees incidence angle (30 degrees phase angle).                  
        This was calculated from calibrated MSI image data and                
        using the photometric angles provided by the shape                    
        model and the observational geometry of the SPICE                     
        files for each image that contributed to that DIM.                    
        The photometric function used to make the correction                  
        was a modified Lunar-Lambert function developed for                   
        lunar mare; see [BUSSEYETAL2001] for details.

        Although the basemaps conform to the PDS standard,                    
        there are currently (August, 2001) no PDS-provided tools that         
        can easily display the basemaps.  The NASAview program should         
        be able to display the basemaps by the time this data is archived.    
        It is suggested that the user use the PDS label and a data analysis   
        tool such as IDL, AVS, Matlab or Khoros to read, display and          
        interpret these images.
