    ===================                                                       
                                                                              
      Launched on February 17, 1996, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous       
      (NEAR) spacecraft will go into orbit around the asteroid 433 Eros on    
      February 14, 2000. The first launch of the Discovery class missions,    
      NEAR will study this S-class asteroid up close, determining its         
      geological characteristics, physical properties and composition         
      [CHENGETAL1997]. The reflected-light spectral data gathered by the      
      Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIS) is a key component of an integrated    
      strategy for the study of Eros. This strategy also includes high        
      resolution imaging from the multispectral imager (MSI)                  
      [VEVERKAETAL1997A], elemental abundance measurements from the           
      X-ray/gamma-ray spectrometer (XGRS) [TROMBKAETAL1997], magnetic         
      field data from the magnetometer (MAG) [ACUNAETAL1997], topographic     
      data from the NEAR laser rangefinder (NLR) [ZUBERETAL1997], and mass    
      and gravity data from the on-board radio science experiment             
      [YEOMANSETAL1997]. NIS will conduct spectral mapping of Eros by         
      measuring reflected sunlight in the wavelength range from 800 to        
      2600 nm. Reflectance spectra of Eros will be used to identify the       
      surface mineral assemblages, to constrain the origin and evolution      
      of the surface, and, in combination with other NEAR data, to explore    
      the links between asteroids and meteorites.                             
                                                                              
      NEAR has traveled a circuitous path on its way to its orbital           
      encounter with Eros [FARQUHARETAL1995], including a swing through       
      the inner main asteroid belt that allowed a flyby of the C-type         
      asteroid 253 Mathilde, a gravity-assist swingby of Earth, and an        
      unplanned initial flyby of Eros itself following an aborted             
      orbit-insertion burn [YEOMANSETAL1999], [VEVERKAETAL1999B]. Due to      
      inadequate power margins at the relatively large heliocentric           
      distance during the target-of-opportunity encounter with Mathilde on    
      June 27, 1997, NIS was not turned on at that time [VEVERKAETAL1997B].   
      The NIS instrument's protective cover was not opened until later in     
      1997, allowing observations of the on-board calibration target          
      (caltarget) and of the Earth and Moon during the January 23, 1998       
      swingby maneuver. NIS first observed Eros in late December 1998         
      [VEVERKAETAL1999A]. Data from the Eros flyby provided a valuable        
      opportunity to evaluate instrument performance.  Observations of Eros   
      will resume on final approach in early 2000 and continue throughout     
      the mission as the orbit is changed in steps from 500 to 35 km radius.  
                                                                              
      NIS was designed to fulfill four key NEAR measurement requirements      
      [VEVERKAETAL1997A]:  1) Map the mineralogical composition of Eros       
      using reflected sunlight 1) Map the distribution and abundance of       
      minerals at scales as small as 300 meters 1) Complement high            
      resolution MSI images and low resolution XGRS elemental distribution    
      maps for definitive identification of rock types composing Eros'        
      surface 1)  Provide information on the physical and textural            
      properties of these surface materials                                   
                                                                              
      In order to fulfill these requirements, the instrument's behavior       
      must be characterized both from rigorous preflight calibration and      
      testing and from in-flight observations over the mission lifetime.      
      This paper reviews the data and techniques used to calibrate the        
      NIS, and discusses initial in-flight results for observations by NIS    
      during the cruise, Earth swingby, and Eros flyby phases of the NEAR     
      mission. The calibration of the instrument will be refined              
      throughout the mission. Table two in the NIS calibration paper contains 
      the science rationale for the phases and can be found in the            
      NIS/DOCUMENT/INSTRUMENT/CALPAPER directory.                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Instrument Description                                                    
    ========================                                                  
      NIS is composed of a grating infrared spectrometer, a scan mirror,      
      two passively cooled detector modules, a mounting bracket,              
      spectrometer electronics, and a data processing unit (DPU) that         
      controls both the NIS and the NEAR magnetometer. NIS has a one-time     
      deployable opaque cover, which was opened on September 24, 1997,        
      three months after the Mathilde flyby [VEVERKAETAL1997B].               
                                                                              
    Hardware                                                                  
    --------                                                                  
      The NIS design (Fig. 1) is copied from an earlier Applied Physics       
      Laboratory (APL) spectrometer - the Defense Meteorological Satellite    
      Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager (SSUSI) - and          
      modified for an infrared wavelength range. [WARRENETAL1997] detail      
      the design characteristics, engineering, and construction of the        
      instrument. A gold-coated scan mirror controls the direction of         
      viewing over a range of 140 degrees. Light reflected from the scan      
      mirror passes through a 20 x 25-mm aperture stop and is imaged by a     
      telescope mirror at a slit. The field of view is selectable at the      
      slit to 'narrow' (0.38 degrees x 0.76 degrees) or 'wide' (0.76          
      degrees x 0.76 degrees) settings. A shutter actuates the narrow         
      slit, with the smaller slit opening coming down over the fixed wide     
      slit. The two slits provide field-of-view sizes of 0.65 x 1.3 km or     
      1.3 x 1.3 km from 100 km distance. A second shutter can be actuated     
      to completely block the slit for dark current measurements. After       
      passing through the slit, light is dispersed and re- imaged off a       
      gold toroidal diffraction grating (a Rowland circle configuration       
      spectrometer) and hits a dichroic beamsplitter mounted at 45 degrees    
      to the beam which transmits or reflects the energy to fall on two       
      32- element linear detector arrays. Reflected 2nd order wavelengths     
      (804-1506 nm) fall on a germanium (Ge) array. Each Ge channel has a     
      bandwidth of 21.6 nm.  The germanium detector has a selectable gain     
      of 1x or 10x. Transmitted 1st order wavelengths (1348-2732 nm) go to    
      an indium-gallium-arsenide (InGaAs) array with 43.1 nm channel          
      bandwidth. [WARRENETAL1997] calibrated the central wavelengths of       
      all NIS channels at three operational temperatures (-7 degrees C,       
      -17 degrees C, and -23 degrees C) and found best-fit Ge spectral        
      calibration given by:                                                   
                                                                              
      lambda (nm) = 794.6 + 21.61*n        (Equation 1)                       
                                                                              
      where n is Ge element number 1-32. The uncertainty of the wavelength    
      calibration over the range of temperatures examined is +/-0.5 nm.       
      InGaAs element center wavelengths are given by:                         
                                                                              
      lambda (nm) = 43.11*n - 50.8        (Equation 2)                        
                                                                              
      where n is InGaAs element number 33-64. The temperature-dependent       
      wavelength uncertainty is approximately +/-3.5 nm.                      
                                                                              
      The lower two channels of the InGaAs detector (channels 33 and 34,      
      at 1372 and 1315 nm respectively) are below the transition              
      wavelength of the dichroic beamsplitter, and therefore always           
      register very low signal. The upper 3 channels (channels 62-64 at       
      2622, 2665, and 2708 nm) are near or in detector cutoff, making the     
      effective upper bound for good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) around       
      2500 nm for the signal level expected at Eros. Additionally, two        
      InGaAs channels (47 and 57, at 1975 nm and 2406 nm) have been           
      extremely noisy since manufacture and do not produce easily usable      
      data. Default operations for NIS utilize the narrow slit, providing     
      a critically sampled spectral resolution of 22 nm in the Ge             
      detector, and 44 nm in the InGaAs detector. The wide slit               
      configuration provides half the spectral resolution (44 nm and 88 nm    
      respectively), but passes twice the light and therefore has a higher    
      SNR.                                                                    
                                                                              
      The NIS scan mirror can rotate the line of sight over 350 steps in      
      0.4-degree increments in the spacecraft Z-X' plane. The +Z axis is      
      perpendicular to the plane of NEAR's solar panels, and +X' is the       
      boresight of the instruments.  Mirror position 0 (nominal caltarget     
      observation geometry) is 30 degrees towards the Z-axis from the         
      boresight. The boresight is aligned with mirror position 75.            
      Position 300 points in the -Z (anti-Sun) direction.                     
                                                                              
      For optimum performance the detectors are operated near -35 degrees     
      C, maintained by passive cooling or active heaters, depending on the    
      thermal environment. A solar-illuminated gold calibration plaque        
      (caltarget) is mounted to the instrument for radiometric stability      
      calibration.  Table I summarizes the NIS specifications. More           
      detailed descriptions of the NIS instrument design are presented in     
      [PEACOCK1997] and [WARRENETAL1997].                                     
                                                                              
    Flight Software                                                           
    ---------------                                                           
      In-flight NIS data are acquired through the use of command sequences    
      to the instrument that specify ten instrument parameters                
      [NISAPLSRS1995], [IZENBERGETAL1998] as follows:  1. Spectrometer        
      sequence ID (0-15). Sixteen sequences can be uploaded and stored        
      while the instrument is powered. Sequences 0, 1, and 2 are              
      hard-coded, but can be redefined.  2. Repeats: the number of times      
      the commanded observations will repeat.  3. Seconds between             
      repeats.  4. Number of observations. This is the number taken during    
      a single repeat of the sequence.  5. Calibration interval               
      (1-65535).  Number of observations before acquisition of dark           
      spectra. This is used to interleave shutter-closed dark observations    
      with data observations.  6. Number of seconds to co-add spectral        
      data in each observation (0-63).  7. Number of rest spectra (0-63).     
      Used when interleaved darks are taken, between spectra acquisition      
      and dark acquisition.  8. Number of co-added seconds of dark signal     
      for interleaved dark spectrum.  9. Number of scan mirror steps          
      between observations (sign indicates direction).  10. Seconds           
      between observations.                                                   
                                                                              
      For the purposes of the software discussion, a 'spectrum' is the        
      result of a one-second integration of the instrument as it gathers      
      data.  An 'observation' is 0-63 consecutive one-second spectra          
      summed together. The example sequence ( 15  3  5  10  5  16  2  4 2     
      2 ) is interpreted as follows: Sequence ID is 15. The sequence will     
      repeat three times, each iteration to contain 10 observations           
      consisting of 16 co-added spectra of accumulated data. The              
      calibration interval of five means that every 5th observation           
      (numbers 5 and 10 in each repeat) will instead co-add 10 spectra of     
      the target, then rest 2 seconds while the shutter closes, then take     
      four co-added spectra of dark signal. After each accumulated            
      observation, the scan mirror will move +2 steps and the instrument      
      will rest two seconds. During each repeat, the mirror will move 20      
      steps. Each repeat is separated by five seconds to allow the mirror     
      to return to the start position. This example sequence would            
      generate 30 NIS observations of the target, and 6 dark                  
      observations.  Choice of the wide or narrow NIS slit, the high or       
      low Ge detector gain, and the starting NIS scan mirror position are     
      specified through separate commands to the instrument."
