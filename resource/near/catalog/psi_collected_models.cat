      =================                                                       
      Several instrument teams from the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous        
      (NEAR) mission derived models of the main mission target, 433           
      Eros. In addition, the Multi-Spectral Imager team also derived          
      a shape model of the secondary target 253 Mathilde. These models        
      and their associated data and descriptions have been collected          
      into this data set for ease of distribution.                            
                                                                              
      The models are divided into groups based on the source of the           
      files:

      ====================                                                    
      These data were culled from the version 1.0 NEAR archive. The           
      data set descriptions from that delivery were converted to              
      document files to accompany this data set. Data labels were             
      updated:                                                                
                                                                              
       1. Information and references that became available in the             
          months following the original archive delivery have been            
          added. In some cases reference publication years have been          
          changed.                                                            
       2. Extrema have been found and added to data product labels            
          where they seemed useful.                                           
       3. DATA_SET_ID, PRODUCT_ID, PRODUCT_NAME and related fields            
          have been changed to reflect the new data set being created.        
                                                                              
      In many cases file names have been changed to something shorter         
      and more mnemonic.                                                      
                                                                              
      The original spherical harmonic model files all contained               
      degenerate tables listing parameters relevant to the model.             
      These lines have been removed from the data file and the                
      parameters included in the description at the top of the                
      labels.                                                                 
                                                                              
      The following additional changes were made to specific data file        
      labels included in this collection:

       o The FILE_RECORDS value, which was incorrect in all but two           
         cases, was corrected.                                                
                                                                              
       MSI Shape Models - Mathilde                                            
       ---------------------------                                            
       o Existing files were extracted from the Thomas optical shape          
         models already in the SBN archives.                                  
                                                                              
       NLR Shape and Gravity models                                           
       ----------------------------                                           
       o The NLR125AR.IMG file was converted to two FITS files:               
                                                                              
          1. A signed 2-byte integer version; and                             
          2. An IEEE-real floating-point version.                             
                                                                              
         In both cases the scaling factor and offset from the original        
         label was applied to the data. For the integer file, the result      
         was rounded to the nearest integer. Minimal FITS headers were        
         created in both cases, and the PDS labels modified accordingly.      
         [Name in this data set: NLR/SHAPEMAP*.FIT]                           
                                                                              
       o The structure included in the NLRT180A.LBL file seemed to bear       
         only a slight resemblance to the actual structure of the data        
         (wrong record size, wrong number of columns, wrong field sizes,      
         etc.).  The following changes were made to the data (and             
         reflected in the label):                                             
                                                                              
         + All records were trimmed to a fixed length (48 bytes).             
         + Embedded blanks were removed from the first record to fit it       
           into the 48-byte length.                                           
         + Blank coefficient fields were filled with the equivalent           
           representation of zero.                                            
         + All 'D' exponentiation operators in the data file were             
           changed to 'E'.                                                    
         [NLR/SHCOEFF.TAB]                                                    
                                                                              
       o The JGE15A01 (ASCII and binary) files were reformatted to            
         follow the style used in the NLR spherical harmonic files.           
         Specifically:                                                        
                                                                              
         + The SHA coefficients file was reformatted to remove trailing       
           zeros and field delimiters. The constants in the header line       
           were moved into the label.                                         
         + The SHB (binary) covariance file was converted to ASCII,           
           output using the same record format and sorted into the same       
           order as the other covariance file.

         the gravity and shape models were converted from the internal        
         format submitted to flat tables more conducive to PDS handling.      
         No data were changed, added or omitted.                              
                                                                              
       o The plate model originally included as part of the shape model       
         file (with the spherical harmonic solution) was pulled out into      
         a separate file.                                                     
                                                                              
       o The triangular plate shape model was reformatted slightly to         
         match the format used in other radar shape models already            
         archived at the SBN.  The principal change consisted of adding       
         flags in the first column of each record to indicate which           
         records defined vertices and which facets.

       o The Bouguer gravity maps were converted to FITS files and the        
         labels modified accordingly.

       o The landmarks file was reformatted to collect the position and       
         uncertainty vector for each landmark into a single record. The       
         label was re-written accordingly."
