    =================                                                         
      This data set contains the NEAR infrared spectrometer (NIS)             
      data for the EROS/ORBIT phase.                                          
                                                                              
      The data are calibrated data, provided in scientific units,             
      that have been formatted into FITS file format (NASA Office             
      of Science and Technology (NOST), 100-1.0). In addition to the          
      raw spectrometer data, a calibration file and algorithm are             
      available. This data set is archived as a set of CDROM images           
      as a part of the NEAR EDR volume set.                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Parameters                                                                
    ==========                                                                
      The only special parameter in the INDEX/INDEX.TAB file is MET,          
      which approximates the Mission Elapsed Time in seconds.                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Data                                                                      
    ====                                                                      
      The data are in a FITS file called the nixel database.                  
      The nixel database maintains large amounts of information               
      along with each spectrum:  instrument housekeeping; observational       
      geometry; footprint location on the target.                             
                                                                              
      Some columns record user inputs that controlled Niscal, the NIS         
      calibration procedure run to generate the values in the table.          
      Those fields are CALIBRATION_MODE_BITS, DARK_MODE, NOISE_MODE,          
      RADIANCE_MODE, and SLIT_MODE.  Those columns' possible values           
      and their meanings are described in the file NIXDB.LBL.                 
                                                                              
      Some columns may be used to determine the type of observation e.g.      
      a spectrum with field-of-view completely on, partially on, or completely
      off the asteroid, a spectrum of the calibration plaque a spectrum with  
      the slit set to narrow or wide and the shutter open or closed (dark).   
      Those columns are SLIT_SHUTTER_FLAG, MIRROR_POSITION, and               
      POLYGON_TYPE_FLAG.  Those columns' possible values                      
      and their meanings are described in the file NIXDB.LBL.                 
                                                                              
      One column describes the data quality index which highlights suspect    
      spectra:  NIS_DQI.  Those columns' possible values                      
      and their meanings are described in the file NIXDB.LBL.

    ==============                                                            
      The files in CALIB/ are the ones used in the actual                     
      calibration of the data in DATA/.  The DESCRIPTION field in each        
      calibration file's PDS label describes what role that file plays        
      in NIS calibration.  The calibration procedure is described in          
      even more detail under the DOCUMENT/ tree.                              
                                                                              
      The GEOMETRY directory is described above.                              
                                                                              
      The calibration plaque for the NIS instrument is made with              
      Infragold LF (trademarked) which is a porous metal surface              
      with a gold coating.

      This data set is released as a CDROM set.

      The processing history includes dark current                            
      and lighting geometry corrections necessary to convert from             
      raw data to I/F units.  The location of each spectrum's                 
      field of view was determined using a 22,540 plate shape                 
      model of Eros, PDS PRODUCT_ID = 'PLATE-EROS-2001012-022540'

      Each spectrum includes a quality flag value in the                      
      data quality field, extracted from the original data label and adjusted 
      by the Niscal program. The values of this keyword are defined           
      below.  The data quality flag is non-zero when there is missing         
      data or other problems with the spectra.  The                           
      possible values of this field are described in the file NIXDB.LBL.
