      A note from SBN about dark frames and 0-ms exposures for MSI:           
      ------------------------------------------------------------            
      For the Eros orbital phase of the archive, image frames as well         
      as dark frames and 0-ms exposures have TARGET_NAME set to EROS          
      in the raw data labels; processed dark exposures are also               
      included in the calibrated data sets.  This can cause confusion         
      because the dark and 0-ms exposures are identified as Eros images       
      yet appear to be ''bad'' exposures because of the idiosyncrasies        
      of the MSI camera.                                                      
                                                                              
      Many MSI sequences were designed such that each image taken by          
      the MSI camera was immediately followed by a 0-ms exposure to           
      correct MSI camera idiosyncrasies.  Also the camera was operated        
      near room temperature so there was a significant amount of dark         
      current generated during typical exposure durations.  For this          
      reason dark exposures of a duration equal to the usual exposure         
      durations were often taken as a usual component of a sequence           
      and, when viewed, appear to be nearly identical to the 0-ms             
      exposures.  Two methods of obtaining dark exposures were often          
      used: (1) closing the shutter during the dark exposure or (2)           
      opening the shutter during the exposure while pointing to               
      ''dark sky''.                                                           
                                                                              
      It appears both techinques were used on several MSI sequences,          
      such as ''seq9_30_xreg'' which was performed on day of year             
      2000-205.  In this particular sequence, the first eight                 
      exposures (m0139720804f4 through m0139723433f4, including their         
      associated 0-ms exposures) appear to have been done with the            
      shutter closed, and then the next six exposures (m0139723596f4          
      through m0139724413f4) appear to have been done with the                
      shutter opened, but with the MSI camera pointed away from the           
      illuminated part of Eros by some small angle.  The fifteenth            
      exposure (m0139724574f4) appears to be the first exposure that          
      picked up a small amount of the illuminated surface of Eros.

      Each data file label includes a quality flag string in the              
      DATA_QUALITY_ID keyword, extracted from the FITS keyword NEAR-008 of    
      the original data label. The fields of this keyword are defined
