      BROWSE          The directory will contain subdirectories yy_doy which  
                      will contain the .GIF files for that day. These files   
                      are made up of up to 54 'thumbnail', reduced-size,      
                      geometrically rectified images scaled in brightness from
                      the minimum to maximum value in the image. This provides
                      at a glance an overview of the images taken on that day.
                      If more than 54 images were taken, there will be        
                      multiple .GIF files, depending on the number of images.
