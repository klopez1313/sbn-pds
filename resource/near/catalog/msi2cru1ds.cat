Data Set Overview                                                             
=================                                                             
NEAR EDR volume sets contain a single data set, from one instrument           
and one mission phase (defined in the phase table in /AAREADME.TXT).          
                                                                              
The first volume of the set is a documentation-only volume and contains       
CALIB, GEOMETRY and other non-data subdirectories. The INDEX directory        
on the first volume contains the summary of all the volumes. The DOCUMENT     
directory on the first volume contains non-changing documentation.            
Subsequent volumes contain only BROWSE, CATALOG, DATA, and INDEX              
subdirectories in order to minimize duplication.  The data volumes also       
contain a DOCUMENT directory, which contains information related to the       
calibration of the data files on that volume.                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
Directory/Product Description:                                                
------------------------------                                                
All images and image products described below are 537 x 244                   
rectangular pixels where the rectangular pixel dimensions are                 
162 x 96 microradians.                                                        
                                                                              
RAW: Raw images. Image in this directory are units of raw DN, as              
received from the spacecraft after data were uncompressed. No editing         
of the data has taken place. Missing transfer frames are represented          
as null pixels.                                                               
                                                                              
RAD: Radiance images. Images in this directory have been calibrated           
to units of radiance using the following procedure. Dark current was          
removed using a model based on position in the image, mission-elapsed         
time, exposure time, and CCD temperature. Frame transfer smear was            
removed using the procedure described in MSICAL.TXT. The image was            
then divided by the flat-field image corresponding to the filter              
through which the image was taken. To convert from these units of             
'corrected DN' to radiance, the image was divided by its exposure             
time, a calibration coefficient (which converts from DNs/time to              
radiance) for that filter, and the temperature dependence of the              
calibration coefficient as described in MSICAL.TXT.                           
                                                                              
CRD: Cleaned radiance images. Images in this directory have been              
calibrated to units of radiance using the following procedure. Dark           
current, background frame transfer smear, and background leaked light         
were removed using the nominal image and one taken with a 0-ms                
exposure within several seconds, through the same filter. The 0-ms            
exposure has a slightly different dark current but the same frame             
transfer smear and leaked light. Dark current was removed separately          
from the two images, using a model based on position in the image,            
mission-elapsed time, exposure time, and CCD temperature. The                 
dark-corrected 0-ms image was subtracted from the dark-corrected              
nominal image. The difference image was then divided by the                   
flat- field image corresponding to the filter through which the               
image was taken. To convert from these units of 'corrected DN' to             
to radiance, the image was divided by its exposure time, a                    
calibration coefficient (which converts from DNs/time to radiance)            
for that filter, and the temperature dependence of the calibration            
coefficient as described in MSICAL.TXT.                                       
                                                                              
CRDDBL: Cleaned, deblurred radiance images. Images in this directory          
have been calibrated to units of radiance beginning with the                  
procedure described for cleaned radiance images (CRD). In addition,           
images were 'deblurred' by application of a Fourier filtering                 
restoration of a degraded image point-spread function, as described           
in MSICAL.TXT.                                                                
                                                                              
IOF: I/F images. Images in this directory have been calibrated to             
units of I/F beginning with the procedure described for radiance              
images (RAD). The images were subsequently divided by pi times the            
solar irradiance expected at the target body's distance from the Sun.         
                                                                              
IOFDBL: Deblurred I/F images. Images in this directory have been              
calibrated to units of I/F beginning with the procedure described             
for I/F images (IOF). In addition, images were 'deblurred' by                 
application of a Fourier filtering resotration of a degreded image            
point-spread funcition, as described in MSICAL.TXT                            
                                                                              
CIF: Cleaned I/F images. Images in this directory have been                   
calibrated to units of I/F beginning with the procedure described             
for cleaned radiance images (CRD). The images were subsequently               
divided by pi times the solar irradiance expected at the target
