      The Near Earth Asteroid Rendevous (NEAR) Mathilde Radio Science         
      (RS) Data Set is a time-ordered collection of raw and partially         
      processed data collected during the NEAR flyby of minor planet          
      253 Mathilde. For more information and the results of the               
      investigation conducted, see 'Estimating the Mass of Asteroid           
      253 Mathilde from Tracking Data During the NEAR Flyby', D.K.

      Only data collected in the month prior to the June 27, 1997             
      flyby through the July 3 trajectory correction maneuver was used        
      for the mass determination. The radio data also supported NEAR          
      Navigation.                                                             
                                                                              
      The data set includes:

      Typical users of these data might analyze range and Doppler             
      measurements in the ODF to derive the NEAR trajectory during            
      the flyby.

      The ODF contains the most important information (range and              
      Doppler) needed by spacecraft navigators and those interested           
      in determining gravitational parameters of Mathilde. Each ODF           
      is accompanied by a full PDS label which describes both the             
      content and format of the associated file.  ODF data types              
      can include those listed below. Only those marked below with an

      ODF's are screened for 'bad' data points, which are removed             
      prior to analysis by the navigation and radio science teams.

      ODFs were issued approximately daily prior to the NEAR                  
      Mathilde flyby, more often during the immediate approach to             
      Mathilde. The individual ODFs were merged into the single               
      file of this dataset.                                                   
                                                                              
      This ODF is stored in the ODF directory under the file name             
      7152O184.ODF, where '7' is the one-digit year (1990's implicit),        
      '152' is the 3-digit day of year for data start, and '184' is           
      the 3-digit day of year for data stop.

      Ancillary files are needed for proper analysis and                      
      interpretation of the radio data (file type ODF).   These are           
      organized in parallel directories and stored approximately              
      chronologically.                                                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
      Earth Orientation Parameter Files (EOP Directory)                       
      ---------------------------------------------------                     
        Earth Orientation Parameter files are produced by the Time            
        and Earth Motion Precision Observation (TEMPO) Group at JPL.          
        These are ASCII files of variable length records.  Each               
        record is delimited by an ASCII line-feed <LF> (ASCII 10).            
        File names have the form  ydddzeee.EOP  where  y  is                  
        the one-digit year (1990s implicit) of the first data in the          
        file (i.e. 199y), ddd is the day-of-year of the first data in         
        the file,  z  is the one-digit year of the last data, and eee         
        is the day-of-year of the last data in the file.  EOP files           
        are typically released on Tuesdays and Fridays. The files             
        cover the most recent nine months of past motion and a                
        prediction for three months into the future; these files are          
        typically 30 KB. Each EOP file is accompanied by a PDS minimal        
        label with file name ydddzeee.LBL.                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
      Ionosphere Calibration Files (ION Directory)                            
      ---------------------------------------------------                     
        Ionosphere Calibration files are produced by the                      
        Tracking System Analytic Calibration (TSAC) Group at JPL.             
        These are ASCII files of variable length records.  Each               
        record is delimited by an ASCII line-feed <LF> (ASCII 10).            
        File names have the form  ydddeeeC.ION  where  y  is                  
        the one-digit year of the first data in the file (1990s are           
        implicit, i.e. 199y),  ddd  is the day-of-year of the first           
        data in the file,  eee  is the day-of-year of the last data in        
        the file, and  C  is a character denoting sequence when more          
        than one file with the same  ydddeee  is handled.  C  starts          
        from 'A' and progresses to 'B', 'C', etc. with increasing             
        numbers of similar coverage files.  Frequently, ION files are         
        released at one week intervals to cover a single month;               
        ydddeeeA.ION would be the file released the first week,               
        ydddeeeB.ION would be the file released the second week,              
        etc.  Each ION file is accompanied by a PDS minimal label with        
        file name ydddeeeC.LBL. Typical file sizes are less than 50KB.        
                                                                              
                                                                              
      Troposphere Calibration Files (TRO Directory)                           
      ---------------------------------------------------                     
        Troposphere Calibration files are produced by the                     
        Tracking System Analytic Calibration (TSAC) Group at JPL.             
        These are ASCII files of variable length records.  Each               
        record is delimited by an ASCII line-feed <LF> (ASCII 10).            
        File names have the form  ydddeeeC.TRO  where  y  is                  
        the one-digit year of the first data in the file (1990s are           
        implicit, i.e. 199y), ddd is the day-of-year of the first data        
        in the file,  eee  is the day-of-year of the last data in the         
        file, and  C  is a character denoting sequence when more than         
        one file with the same ydddeee is handled.  C  starts from 'A'        
        and progresses to 'B', 'C', etc. with increasing numbers of           
        similar coverage files. TRO files are typically released at           
        the beginning of a month and cover the previous month. Each           
        TRO file is accompanied by a PDS minimal label with file name         
        ydddeeeC.LBL.  Typical file sizes are less than 50 KB.

      --------------------------                                              
        Two file types are included in the TXT directory. The first           
        type is NMLMODL.TXT and is accompanied by a minimal PDS label         
        NMLMODL.LBL. It is the nominal set of namelist parameters             
        used to define physical characteristics of the spacecraft's           
        motion and tracking observables used by the JPL orbit                 
        determination software suite.  The second file is                     
        PARAMSUM.TXT, accompanied by minimal PDS label PARAMSUM.LBL,          
        which is a summary of the estimated (solved-for) parameter            
        set. GM9 is the solved-for Mathilde GM in units of km^3/s^2.

      Because such software must usually operate at the bit-level and
