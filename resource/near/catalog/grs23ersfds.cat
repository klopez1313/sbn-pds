     science data products from observations acquired by the Near Earth       
     Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) instrument

     The following sections describe this data set and its documentation      
     delivered as part of the NEAR XGRS instrument team delivery to           
     NASA's Planetary Data System.                                            
                                                                              
                                                                              
   Data Set Information                                                       
   ====================                                                       
     It was found that the on-surface attitude of the spacecraft did          
     not facilitate the use of the fixed high gain antenna and the            
     low gain antenna was used for the duration of the on-surface             
     mission.  As a result available telemetry rates did not                  
     facilitate the downlink of the full complement of instrument,            
     engineering and ancillary information with priority being                
     given to selected spectra.  The first two days of on-surface             
     activity were used to calibrate the detectors to account for             
     deviations of temperature between orbital and on surface                 
     operations.  Adjustments were then made to the instrument high           
     voltage to improve the energy gain in the escape peak spectra.           
                                                                              
     In this configuration, several long term integrations were               
     collected and spectra taken for the four longest integrations            
     along with ancillary information were used to generate the               
     Level 2 science products on the first volume of this data set,           
     NXERSF_2001.  For the Level 3 products on the second volume,             
     NXERSF_2002, spectra from the two longest integration times              
     (total duration of 586320 seconds) were summed for NAI, ANTI,            
     NAI1, and NAI2 spectra.  The higher counting rate BGO spectrum           
     was taken for a single integration (total duration of 346480             
     seconds) and summed.                                                     
                                                                              
     Each of set of spectra were corrected for channel rollover               
     which occurred in several instances due to long integration              
     times causing accumulations of counts in some channels to                
     exceed and rollover the maximum numerical range of the 2 byte            
     channel.  Higher counting rates in the lower energies of each            
     spectrum incurred multiple rollovers and algorithms were                 
     developed to rectify this effect.                                        
                                                                              
     A second correction made to the on-surface spectra is the                
     removal of differential non-linearities (DNL) contained within           
     the spectra.  The effect being high frequency spikes in                  
     channels spaced at regular intervals within the spectrum.                
     (DNL)`s were removed using a 3rd order polynomial fit and                
     smoothing function for a sliding boxcar of 21 channels                   
     through each raw spectrum.

       As a result three Level 2 spectra were generated for the BGO           
       instrument and three for the NAI instrument and finally the            
       NAI 1 and 2 escape spectra only were collected as the last             
       spectra integrated from the surface.  The resulting 17                 
       individual Level 2 spectra are listed with ancillary                   
       information in the following table:

       allows the files to be read by MacOS, DOS, and UNIX operating          
       systems.
