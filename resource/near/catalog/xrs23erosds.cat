The XRS Level 2 data products in this archive include daily                   
time series of spectra collected by the instrument along with                 
selected spacecraft engineering and instrument configuration and              
orbital ephemerides. Supporting documentation includes as to the              
specifics of how these data were generated.  A supporting BROWSE              
facility was included to facilitate high level overview of                    
asteroid and solar flourescence activity, which is in the form of             
time and resolution correlated histographic images of flourescence            
detection by the asteroid and solar pointing detectors.  Asteroid             
surface coverage is included in the form of an image with six                 
orthogonal views of the asteroid of counts collected by the                   
asteroid pointing unfiltered detector.  The daily images are                  
integrated through an XRS browser facility XGRSBROWSE.HTML included           
BROWSE Directory.                                                             
                                                                              
The XRS Level-3 data products in this archive include the most optimal        
XRS sampling of flourescence of the asteroid surface during selected          
solar flares.  These data include specific time series of spectra             
collected by the instrument along with selected spacecraft                    
engineering and instrument configuration and orbital ephemerides.             
This portion of the data set is identical to the Level-2 format               
specific to the time of each flare.  A second partition of the                
data set is a derived product in which a composite set of data is             
generated by summing spectra to increase signal to noise during the           
flare.  Selected ephemerides and engineering parameters are averaged          
for the composite set of information.

The Level 2and 3 data products comprise the time series of the XRS            
instrument's science data in physical units. At each integration              
time the instrument Data Processing Unit (DPU) samples instrument             
spectra accumulated during the integration period as well as                  
instrument and engineering configuration information.  Ground                 
processing activities at the University of Arizona produce Derived            
Engineering and Spatial Ephemerides information.  The Level-2/3 data          
are then combined into integral products within a relational                  
database and exported as an integral Level-2 product. Each XRS record         
is comprised of the following logical data units:
