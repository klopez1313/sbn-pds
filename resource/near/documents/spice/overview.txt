============                                                                  
                                                                              
   This document provides an overview of this volume of the Near              
   Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) SPICE Data Archive, including             
   a complete listing of the volume contents.                                 
                                                                              
   This volume contains navigation and ancillary data in the form of          
   SPICE System kernel files for the NEAR spacecraft during the mission       
   phase with name: EROS/ORBIT                                                
   covering the year and daynumbers (YYYYDDD) 2000011 through 2001043.        
   See the mission phases table below for a description of the phases of the  
   mission.                                                                   
                                                                              
   The SPICE kernel files contain geometric and much other ancillary          
   information needed to recover the full value of science instrument         
   data. In particular SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary         
   ephemerides, instrument mounting alignments, spacecraft orientation,       
   spacecraft sequences of events, data needed for certain time               
   conversions, etc. Data in the SPICE kernel files can be accessed           
   using the NAIF (Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility)             
   software necessary to read these files.                                    
                                                                              
   The NEAR Science Data Center (SDC) has created this data set for long      
   term archive by the Planetary Data System (PDS), as specified in the       
   NEAR Project Archive Generation, Validation and Transfer Plan              
   (February 1998).                                                           
                                                                              
   This data set is a part of the NEAR level 1b data set delivery as          
   described by the NEAR PDS Data Archive Plan. The Plan also describes       
   the higher level data products, which will become separate PDS data sets.  
                                                                              
   The February 1998 Plan document is in the DOCUMENT subdirectory of this    
   data set, in the file PDSARCHIVEPLAN, in text (.TXT) and rich text (.RTF)  
   formats. The included plan is dated February 1998. It is expected to be    
   updated with final definitions of higher level products. The revised plan  
   will be included in later phase data sets.

   This volume has been formatted according to the ISO-9660 level 2

   This volume does not contain any Extended Attribute Records (XAR).         
   Thus, some VAX/VMS users may have problems accessing files on this         
   volume.

============                                                                  
                                                                              
   All text documents and other meta information files such as                
   descriptions, PDS object definitions and detached PDS labels are           
   stream format files, with a carriage return (ASCII 13) and a line          
   feed character (ASCII 10) at the end of the record.  This allows           
   the files to be read by MS-DOS/Windows, Unix, and VMS operating            
   systems.                                                                   
                                                                              
   The SPICE kernel data files on were prepared to be used                    
   under a UNIX environment. Therefore all SPICE text kernel files are        
   UNIX text files, with a line feed character (ASCII 10) at the end          
   of the line, and all SPICE binary kernels files are UNIX binary            
   files in which bit pattern structures for double precision and             
   integer numbers follow IEEE standard. NAIF software is available to        
   convert these files for use on other systems.
