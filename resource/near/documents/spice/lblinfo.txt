   PDS labels for NEAR SPICE kernel files contained on this                   
   CD are stored as detached files in the same directories where the          
   actual data files are. The naming convention for the label files           
   on this CD is the following: for a particular data file the label          
   file has exactly the same name with extension ".LBL".
