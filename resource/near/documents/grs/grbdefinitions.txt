 definition - Crosstalk counter - a count of the high energy gamma ray        
events which occurred over an entire record period for the most recently      
completed Xray period (independent of gamma ray sensor masking);              
individual anti-coincident high energy gamma ray events each cause this       
counter to be incremented by 1; coincident gamma ray events cause this        
counter to be incremented by 1 if either or both are high energy; each        
time the counter is incremented, the three primary Xray sensor channels       
(unfiltered, Mg, and Al) are

 definition - Encoded crosstalk thresholds - an encoding of the thresholds    
which are used in determining "high energy" gamma ray events in the           
context of crosstalk processing; events whose energy bins exceed this         
threshold will be considered high energy (for the purposes of crosstalk       
processing only)

 encoded thr 1022 or 2222 = NaI and BGO crosstalk thr both 1022               
 encoded thr 2223 = NaI crosstalk thr 1022; BGO crosstalk thr 1023

 encoded thr 2323 = NaI and BGO crosstalk thr both 1023                       
 Note: a crosstalk threshold of 1023 effectively disables crosstalk           
processing for that sensor, since only events in energy bin > 1023 (none)     
would be considered high energy;                                              
 a crosstalk threshold of 1022 enables crosstalk processing for that          
sensor with high energy bins considered to be energy bin 1023 only.
