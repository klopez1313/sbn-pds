A brief description follows:                                                  
                                                                              
1.  Radiometric Calibration                                                   
                                                                              
For radiometric calibration, the main objective of inflight                   
calibration is solving for variables in the calibration equation for          
converting image data numbers (DNs) to physical units of radiance, W          
m-2 micro m-1 sr-1.                                                           
                                                                              
The calibration equation has two forms.  The first form is applied            
when the field-of-view is underfilled, or when the field is filled by         
accompanying 0-ms exposures taken close in time and in the same filter        
are not available:

--------------------------------------------------------      (1)

where DN(x,y,f,T,t,c) is raw DN measured by the pixel in column x, row        
y through filter f at exposure time t and temperature T with the cover        
status c open or closed. Dark(x,y,t,T,MET) is the dark closed.                
Dark(x,y,t,T,MET) is the dark level modeled for this pixel at exposure        
time t, temperature T, and mission-elapsed time MET, time t,                  
temperature T, and mission-elapsed time MET, derived from a model             
based on dedicated dark frames taken throughout the the mission.              
Smear(x,y,t) is the scene-dependent readout smear for the pixel at            
exposure time t.  Flat(x,y,f,c) is the flat field for filter f with           
the cover status c open or closed. Coef(f) is the coefficient for             
converting dark-removed, flat field and smear-corrected DN from filter        
f to radiance, for a baseline exposure time of 100 ms. Resp(f,T) is           
the responsivity for this filter at temperature T relative to the             
baseline, inflight operating temperature (-29.6 deg C). Atten(f,c), if        
appropriate, is the attenuation of incoming signal by the lens cover          
in filter f when the cover status c is closed.  Exp(t) is exposure            
time in milliseconds between 1 and 999 ms.                                    
                                                                              
The second version of the calibration equation is used for monochrome         
sequences having as an objective photometric accuracy, or for color           
sequences, in either case when the asteroid overfills the FOV:                
                                                                              
Radiance(x,y,f,T,t,c) =                                                       
                                                                              
{[DN(x,y,f,T,t,c)-Dark(x,y,MET,T,t)] -

--------------------------------------------------            (2)             
                                                                              
Flat(x,y,f,c) * Coef(f) * Resp(f,T) * Atten(f,c) * Exp(t)                     
                                                                              
where DN(x,y,f,T,t,c) is raw DN of an intended image scene.                   
DN(x,y,f,T,0,c) is an image acquired a few seconds later at an                
exposure time of 0 ms. The 0-ms image contains no real scene                  
information, but has the same transfer smear and leaked light as the          
primary image. It differs only in (a) the exact position of the scene         
at the sub-pixel level and (b) a slightly lesser accumulation of dark         
current at the shorter exposure time. For a typical Eros image exposed        
to a DN of approximately 2000, this approach removes approximately 20         
DN of leaked light ignored in equation 1. Application of this version         
of the equation requires two raw images to produce one calibrated,            
reduced image, and this is much more resource-intensive.                      
                                                                              
1.1. Dark Images                                                              
                                                                              
The signal level measured in space is the sum of three components:            
(a) dark current from thermal electrons,                                      
(b) a bias of approximately 80 intentionally added to the output              
to prevent occurrence of negative values which would reach ground             
as zeroes in the 12-bit DN words, and                                         
(c) low-level periodic noise picked up by spacecraft electronics.             
Odd and even columns have slightly different biases                           
(by approximately 6 DN), an inherent property of this Thomson CCD.            
This difference introduces a fixed pattern which,                             
when subtracted from the data, has no measurable effect                       
on accuracy or signal-to-noise ratio of the image data.                       
                                                                              
The model for dark current depends on CCD temperature T,                      
exposure time t, mission-elapsed time MET, and row number y:                  
                                                                              
Dark(y,MET,T,t) =                                                             
                                                                              
(a1_offset + a1_coeff*y) + ((a2_offset + a2_coeff*y)*MET) +                   
((a3_offset + a3_coeff*y)*T) + t*((b1_offset + b1_coeff*y) +                  
((b2_offset + b2_coeff*y)*T))                                                 
                                                                              
(3)                                                                           
                                                                              
where a1_offset is an offset, a1_coeff is a multiplicative                    
coefficient, and y is row incrementing from 1 to 244.                         
These ten constants have separate values for                                  
odd and even columns. All values are given in Table 1.

1.2. Response Uniformity                                                      
                                                                              
The pixel-to-pixel variation in CCD response to a uniform                     
extended source, the "flat field," was measured  onground,                    
and retested during flight. The flat-field correction                         
effectively removes pixel-to-pixel signal variations, with residuals          
at the levels expected for shot noise at measured DN levels                   
(i.e., approximately one part in 200). Files containing                       
Flat(x,y,f,c) for each filter with the cover off are listed in the            
table below. For the condition of the cover still on, that                    
flat-field file is multiplied by the ratio of the flat fields                 
with the cover on and off.                                                    
                                                                              
All images acquired at or after mission elapsed time (MET)                    
6427889 (2 May 1996) have the cover off, and all the images

1.3. Readout Smear                                                            
                                                                              
MSI is shuttered electronically. An image is exposed for a                    
nominal integration (exposure) time, following which it is                    
transferred in 0.9 ms to a memory zone on the CCD from which                  
analog signal is digitized line-by-line. Accumulation of                      
signal continues during the 0.9 ms of frame transfer.                         
The finite duration of the frame transfer therefore induces a streak          
"frame transfer smear" in the wake of an illuminated object in                
the field of view, parallel to the direction of frame                         
transfer. The magnitude of the smear to be removed from the pixel in          
column x and line y in an image integrated for exposure time t is:            
                                                                              
Smear(x,y,t) = Summation (1 to y-1) {(t2/t) *                                 
                                                                              
DN(x,y,f,T,t,c) - Dark(x,y,T,t) - Smear(x,y,t)

where t2 is the time for frame transfer (0.9 ms) divided                      
by the number of lines in the image in the direction of frame                 
transfer (244 lines).                                                         
                                                                              
1.4. Linearity                                                                
                                                                              
The underlying assumption of radiometric calibration of MSI is                
that response of the CCD is linear with exposure time, to the                 
digitization limit of 4095. Onground testing summarized                       
summarized by [HAWKINSETAL97] shows that this condition                       
is satisfied onground. This assumption was tested again                       
after launch, placing an upper limit of 1% on the variations                  
in linearity with signal level.                                               
                                                                              
1.5. Cover Attenuation                                                        
                                                                              
The attenuation of light by the lens cover is of significance                 
mostly because the first of the two scheduled lunar calibration               
sequences was acquired with the cover on, while the second                    
lunar calibration sequence, in January 1998, was acquired with                
the cover off. The attenuation in filter 0 is poorly determined.

1.6. Radiometric Responsivity                                                 
                                                                              
Radiometric responsivity results from the efficiency                          
in converting photons of light into photoelectrons measured by the            
instrument, and is the key variable for converting DN levels into             
physical units of radiance.

1.7. Relative responsivity as a function of temperature                       
                                                                              
The temperature dependence of responsivity in each filter                     
Resp(f,T) was determined from fitting onground measurements                   
of the large integrating sphere at different temperatures                     
[HAWKINSETAL1997]. This is expressed as a second-order                        
polynomial:

where T is temperature in Celsius and the function is                         
unity at the nominal inflight operating temperature of -29.6C.                
                                                                              
2.  Geometric Calibration                                                     
                                                                              
2.1. Image Scale and Distortion                                               
                                                                              
The best focal length is 166.850 +/- 0.10 mm. This translates                 
into accurate angular dimensions for a mean pixel of                          
95.9 microradians x 161.8 microradians, and a field-of-view of                
2.95 degrees x 2.26 degrees.                                                  
                                                                              
2.2. Imager Alignment                                                         
                                                                              
To within about 150 microradians (1 pixel) accuracy,                          
pointing over the course of the entire mission may be defined                 
by simple linear functions of instrument deck                                 
temperature T(deck). In an image reference frame, with                        
the origin at the upper left, the column (sample) number increases            
in the +z direction in the spacecraft reference frame. The line (row)         
number in an image increases in the -y' direction in the spacecraft           
reference frame. The offset position from the spacecraft                      
x' axis in the column or spacecraft +z direction is approximated by:          
                                                                              
column offset (microradians) = -1260 - 45.81*T(deck)        (6)               
(+/- 113 microradians), r = 0.83                                              
                                                                              
The offset position in the line or spacecraft -y' direction                   
is approximated by:                                                           
                                                                              
line offset (microradians) = -744  (+/-99 microradians)     (7)               
                                                                              
3. Scattered Light                                                            
                                                                              
Scattered light is measured using inflight images of Canopus.                 
A failed Eros orbit insertion maneuver on 20 December 1998,                   
in which more than 28 kg of hydrazine was expended by attitude                
control jets on NEAR, caused the deposit of burn products                     
on the outer optic of the MSI.  This resulted in a wavelength-                
dependent degradation of the system point-spread function.                    
The scattered light is progressively worse in the shortest                    
and longest wavelength filters, especially at 450 and 1050 nm.                
The degraded PSF is restored using the Fourier                                
filtering technique described by [LIETAL2000].                                
                                                                              
4. Processing levels                                                          
                                                                              
NEAR images are archived in up to 8 forms which have                          
undergone differing calibration pathways and levels of                        
subsequent processing, depending on the target body,                          
time during the mission, and intent of the observation:
