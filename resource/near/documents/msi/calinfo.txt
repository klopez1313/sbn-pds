The CALIB directory contains a set of files that are useful for the           
calibration of the NEAR MultiSpectral Imager (MSI).  The files in the         
CALIB directory itself are used in conjunction with the MSI calibration       
software, while the files in the MSIBANDPASS directory are descriptions       
of the MSI filter responses.                                                  
                                                                              
For a description of the MSI calibration processes and levels, refer to       
/NIEROS_2001/DOCUMENT/MSICAL.TXT.  The document includes the two forms of the 
calibration equations applied to MSI images and describes the MSI processing  
levels such as RAD (image calibrated to units of radiance) and                
CIFDBL (cleaned and deblurred image calibrated to units of I/F).

The /CALIB/MSIBANDPASS directory contains files describing the                
bandpasses of the filters used in conjunction the NEAR Multispectral          
Imager.  One file is included for each filter, giving the scaled              
response as a function of wavelength.  This information was provided by       
Scott Murchie.

In order to correct for sensitivity and non-uniformity of the MSI system,     
images were acquired before launch of the interior of a spectralon

For the period of the mission when the transparent cover was used there       
are two flat fields used.  After the cover was removed only one flat          
field is used, the files named with FLAT?_31C.FIT were used for both          
periods.  The * is an integer representing a particular filter                
identification number.
