ABSTRACT                                                                      
                                                                              
        The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft's command and    
data handling (C&DH) system is designed to manage complex operations and to   
collect data when the spacecraft is out of contact with ground control. During
ground contacts, the C&DH system accepts uplink commands and memory loads that
describe a time-ordered set of events to follow, and it transmits previously  
recorded data back to the ground station. This article describes the overall  
C&DH system, gives details on each of the components, and tells how the system
was tested prior to spacecraft integration. Solid-state data recorders and    
flight computers are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION                                                                  
                                                                              
Although the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft is in ground    
contact at least several times a week, the spacecraft does most of its work   
independently; that is, it operates on sequences of commands that are received
via the X-band radio frequency(RF) uplink and stored on-board. Scenarios range
from minimal housekeeping during cruise mode to recording data continuously   
during a 16-h cycle of science measurements at the asteroid Eros. Normally,   
ground contacts are needed only to send recorded data back to Earth and to    
receive the next series of commands to be executed. However, on-board autonomy
rules will sense events that threaten the health of the spacecraft. The       
strategy in these cases is to enter a safe mode and wait for ground commands  
to direct recovery. The command and data handling (C&DH) system communicates  
with the ground via the X-band RF system, processes commands, formats and     
stores data, and autonomously protects the health of the spacecraft.          
                                                                              
OVERVIEW                                                                      
                                                                              
Data Flow and Spacecraft Interfaces                                           
The NEARC&DH system has electrical interfaces throughout the spacecraft.Figure
1 shows the C&DH system in relation to the other packages on-board the        
spacecraft. The flow of data and electrical power over these interfaces is    
managed by the embedded computers in the command and telemetry processors     
(CTPs).                                                                       
Command and telemetry signals pass between the RF receivers and transmitters  
and the C&DH system as serial streams. Table 1 shows the bit rates supported  
by the NEAR RF links. Formats of these serial streams are based on standards  
published by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS).1 4    
NEAR follows CCSDS standards regarding headers for transfer frames and        
packets, Reed Solomon coding, convolution coding, and command operating       
procedure version 1 (COP-1) for the "handshake" between ground station and    
spacecraft for commanding. Commands use CCSDS telecommand transfer frame      
structures containing nonpacketized NEAR-unique command bit formats. Telemetry
data use the CCSDS transfer frame and packet structures. CCSDS headers provide
virtual channel (VC) designations for telemetry frames. Assignment of VCs is  
mission dependent. NEAR uses four VCs, referred to as VC0, VC1, VC2, and VC3. 
These four channels have specific meanings, as defined in Table 2. Within a   
telemetry frame are telemetry packets that contain data from one source, such 
as a subsystem or subprocess. Table 2 lists the packets defined for NEAR. A   
telemetry packet is designated by its application process identifier, a number
from 0 to 13. The C&DH 1553B data bus is a time multiplexed, bidirectional dat
interface5 for communication between bus controller and remote terminals. It i
useful for all intraspacecraft messages except those that would overload its  
1-megabit per second data rate. Dedicated high-speed serial circuits are      
provided for the multispectral imagers that must transfer images at 2 megabits
per second to the solid-state data recorders (SSDRs).                         
Power switching merits a special dedicated control and status interface to the
CTPs,because the capability for switching relay contacts under fault condition
is critical. Relay contacts from power switching are used to turn spacecraft  
+28-V bus power on and off to other packages and in some cases to control     
discrete functions.                                                           
Discrete interface lines, i.e., single wires, are used for distributing the   
1-Hz synchronization pulse (time tick) to spacecraft subsystems. A set of     
discrete line interfaces is also provided for fault protection between the CTP
and the attitude interface units.                                             
                                                                              
Redundancy and Cross Strapping                                                
System reliability concerns dictated that the NEAR C&DH system have no        
credible single point of failure that could compromise the mission. Figure 1  
shows the configuration in which full hardward redundancy is provided for C&DH
components. Cross strapping at critical points makes use of the redundancy.   
Both CTP 1 and CTP 2 are powered and operational for the entire mission. The  
command function is actively redundant, which means that both CTPs accept and 
decode all uplink signals from both sides of the RF system. Control bits in   
the command message headers prevent any command from being executed more than 
once. Only one CTP at a time can be in control of telemetry generation, the   
data recorders, and the 1553B data bus. The position of a relay in the power  
switching unit is used to select the CTP used for active telemetry and 1553B  
bus control. Thus, where spacecraft systems are redundant in a stand-by sense,
the active side is selected by command. Finally, the 1553B data bus is a fully
redundant system in itself. It features redundant cable harnessing, drivers,  
and receivers, as well as a message parity error detection scheme with        
automatic retry for failed messages.                                          
Stored Command and Autonomous Fault Protection Capabilities                   
Commands from the ground station can be executed as they are received or can  
be stored for later execution. Up to 10,000 commands can be stored per CTP.   
Stored commands can be time tagged for execution at a specific value of       
mission elapsed time (MET), or they can be organized into a macro that is     
called by another command. More details on stored commanding are described in 
the section on C&DH software.                                                 
Autonomous fault protection is based on autonomy rules that are uploaded and  
stored in special locations in the CTP memory. Each rule can sense up to two  
telemetry points, test them separately for limits, and logically combine the  
test results. When a rule "fires," it causes a specific command to be executed
Within each CTP are four levels of hardware watchdog timers to protect against
processor failures. In order of time-out period, they are the RTX2010         
microprocessor wait-state time-out (10.6 ms), the 1-s polling loop time-out   
(1.001 s), the 1553B bus initializer time-out (4.0 s), and the "last resort   
timer," which fires if no command is received from the ground for 12 days. The
occurrence of any of these events will result in a processor hard reset. Such 
reset reloads computer software and default autonomy rules from electrically  
erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) devices on the computer board 
and resets all hardware.                                                      
                                                                              
Management of Stored Data                                                     
NEAR mission scenarios require science and engineering data to be stored      
on-board for later transmission to the ground station. As shown in Fig. 1, two
SSDRs provide this function. They have capacities of 1024 and 512 megabits.   
Recorder input output circuits are fully cross strapped between the two CTPs. 
Either or both of the SSDRs can be operated at any time, according to mission 
needs. Data recording rates are driven by the availability of science data    
packets. This scheme gives maximum flexibility for allocating recorder        
capacity. For NEAR, the quantity of science data delivered to the ground      
station is limited by the bandwidth of the X-band RF downlink, not by the     
capacity of the recorders. NEAR is the first APL spacecraft to use solid-state
devices for spaceborne mass storage.                                          
                                                                              
Timing and Synchronization                                                    
Timing for the NEAR C&DH system is driven by a crystal oscillator and fixed-  
hardware divide chain in the active (bus controller) CTP.All of the frequencie
for bit rates, 8-Hz 1553B bus minor frames, 1-Hz time tick,etc., come from thi
chain; thus, all C&DH events are synchronized. Given the downlink telemetry   
frame length of 8832 bits (from CCSDS), the oscillator frequency and downlink 
bit rates were chosen so that all frame rates are multiples or even divisions 
of the 1-Hz time tick. The MET is a count kept in CTP software of the 1-Hz tim
ticks.A length of 32 bits allows MET to run continuously throughout the missio
without rolling over. MET, which was set to zero at launch, is used to time ta
all downlink telemetry frames and packets.                                    
The value of MET is distributed once per second by messages on the C&DH 1553B 
bus to each remote terminal. The remote terminal can get a 1-s time marker to 
an accuracy of several milliseconds by detecting an event on the 1553B bus.   
Three of the science digital processor units require more accuracy, and, as   
shown in Fig. 1, receive a hardware 1-Hz time tick pulse from the CTP.        
The MET and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) are correlated on the ground.    
Correlation is based on the measured UTC of receipt of a transfer frame, the  
value of MET in that frame, and the known distance from spacecraft to ground  
station.                                                                      
                                                                              
COMMAND and TELEMETRY PROCESSOR FLIGHT HARDWARE                               
                                                                              
The CTP flight hardware processes uplink command messages, formats downlink   
telemetry data, and keeps spacecraft time. It is fully redundant and consists 
of two mechanical assemblies, each housing six electronics boards. Figure 2 is
a photograph of one of the two processor assemblies before final installation 
of the flight cover. The following paragraphs describe CTP functionality, as  
well as some of the processor's significant design features.                  
                                                                              
Functional Description                                                        
Figure 3 is a functional diagram of one of the CTP assemblies. The processor  
performs the following spacecraft functions:                                  
1.     Processes real-time and time-tagged uplink command messages and outputs
the appropriate command data over the 1553B data bus or one of several        
dedicated command interfaces                                                  
2.     Gathers and formats real-time and recorded science and housekeeping    
data and downlinks the data at one of eight selectable downlink data rates    
3.     Encodes downlink data in accordance with the commanded operating mode  
using Reed Solomon and convolutional techniques                               
4.     Formats and stores real-time science and housekeeping data on the      
on-board SSDR for subsequent playback and reformatting of the data for        
transmission on the downlink                                                  
5.     Detects anomalous spacecraft conditions, including power bus           
undervoltage conditions, attitude control system safing flags, and            
out-of-limit housekeeping data, and reconfigures the spacecraft in accordance 
with uploaded and stored control sequences.                                   
6.     Maintains spacecraft time, distributes time data over the 1553B data   
bus, and embeds time data in all formatted data outputs                       
Both CTPs are always powered, one serving as the 1553B bus controller and the 
other as a 1553B bus remote terminal. Each processor requires approximately 23
mA at 128 V in its normal operating mode.                                     
Board Descriptions                                                            
Figure 4 shows the processor board, one of the six printed-wiring electronics 
boards. All boards but the flight direct current (DC)/DC converter board are  
22 3 20 cm. Each board performs specific processor functions.                 
                                                                              
Processor Board                                                               
The processor board design is based on the RTX2010 microprocessor and the     
United Technologies Microelectronics Center Summit MIL-STD-1553B bus          
controller. Fault tolerance features added to the design include memory error 
detection and correction electronics, as well as memory write protection. The 
processor provides 32,000 words of EEPROM, which is used to hold program,     
constants, and autonomy rules, and 64,000 words of random access memory.      
                                                                              
Housekeeping Board                                                            
 The housekeeping board contains the state machine logic and interface        
electronics necessary to gather and condition 31 single-ended analog voltage  
channels, 31 differential analog voltage channels, 31 AD590 temperature       
transducer output channels, 31 platinum wire temperature sensor channels, 24  
digital telltale channels, and 8 serial digital channels once every second and
to transfer the data to the processor board. Each housekeeping board contains 
two separate state machine programs one for when the processor is functioning 
as the bus controller, and one for when the processor is functioning as a     
remote terminal on the 1553B data bus.                                        
Encoder Board                                                                 
The main purpose of the encoder board is to encode telemetry data received fro
the processor board using Reed Solomon and convolutional coding standards and 
to serially transmit the encoded data to the telemetry conditioning unit. The 
convolutional encoding is rate 1/2, constraint length 7, or else rate 1/6,    
constraint length 15. The encoding is done according to CCSDS recommendations 
and is a means of keeping downlink transmissions from corrupting data. The    
encoder board also contains redundant interfaces to the command detector units
to collect telemetry data and to control the uplink data rate.                
                                                                              
Common Interface Board                                                        
Dedicated serial digital data command outputs and power switching matrix      
control signals are generated on the common interface board. Innovative design
features include rise-time control on all serial data outputs to minimize     
interference with other signals and interface overvoltage protection circuitry
to ensure C&DH subsystem functionality should a converter fail in one         
processor. In addition, the common interface board includes uplink command    
interface logic and circuitry to control playback of the SSDR.                
Transfer Frame Generator Board                                                
The transfer frame generator board contains a precision temperature-compensate
crystal oscillator and the timing chain logic necessary to maintain accurate  
mission time and to generate all of the internal C&DH clock signals. Additiona
processor functions performed on this board include gathering high-speed      
science data from the Multispectral Imager, formatting Imager data into       
transfer frames stored on the SSDR, and processing spacecraft bus voltage and 
attitude anomaly flags.                                                       
                                                                              
DC/DC Converter Board                                                         
The CTP power converter uses two modules produced by Interpoint to convert the
128-V direct current power from the spacecraft into  15-V and                 
15-V regulated DC power for use by the C&DH electronics. Another Interpoint   
module is used to filter the input power to meet electromagnetic interference 
requirements. The converter contains custom circuitry to provide output       
overvoltage and low-input voltage turn-on protection.                         
Package Design                                                                
Each CTP flight unit consists of six multilayer electronics boards and a      
motherboard, with overall dimensions of 24 3 24 3 17 cm and a weight of 5 kg. 
The chassis of the C&DH is machined magnesium ZK 60A-75 with a minimum        
thickness of 1.5 mm. The design uses an integral housing for improved thermal 
control and includes separate compartments for the power converter and the    
digital electronics to eliminate potential cross talk.                        
The CTP board assemblies consist primarily of surface-mounted components      
populated on both sides to minimize board area. The printed wiring board      
designs use polyimide glass material with a high glass-transition temperature.
To meet the requirements imposed by the launch environment, each board is sup-
ported by a set of wedge lock card guides and a stiffener.                    
CTP was designed for only conductive cooling to ensure that junction          
temperatures are held within operational limits. For highly dissipative       
devices, an additional aluminum heat sink was bonded to the board to improve

C&DH SOFTWARE                                                                 
                                                                              
Background                                                                    
The most pressing requirements that had to be addressed during the C&DH       
software development effort were programmatic constraints. To meet the NEAR   
launch date, C&DH software had to be ready for installation on the spacecraft 
at the outset of the integration and test phase; other spacecraft components  
could not be operated by the integration and test ground system without a     
functioning C&DH. An early program decision was made that C&DH software could 
not be changed via upload commands after launch. This placed added emphasis on
early requirements definition and exhaustive testing of the implementation, as
well as mandating a software design that could be flexibly configured by mode 
commands and parameter uploads. In addition, NEAR development began when the  
costly and very public failures of the Clementine and Mars Observer missions  
were fresh reminders to NASA and the aerospace community of the importance of 
autonomous fault detection and correction capabilities. Thus, early delivery, 
an inflexible launch date, the need for configurable yet robust software, and 
the need for extensive autonomous capabilities for health and safety were the 
biggest design challenges.                                                    
                                                                              
C&DH Software Overview                                                        
The NEAR C&DH software is implemented as compiled FORTH code resident in 64   
kilobytes of main memory of the CTP RTX2010 microprocessor board. The FORTH   
language was selected because the RTX2010 processor design uses a native      
instruction set modeled after FORTH for optimum processor efficiency. FORTH on
the RTX2010 also offers the advantage of supporting both interactive and      
compiled software modes.                                                      
The context diagram of Fig. 5 depicts the C&DH software environment and       
external interfaces. The software is structured as an executive that is define
by a 1-s major frame subdivided into eight 125-ms minor frames. The top-level 
software functions controlled by the executive include the following: uplink  
processor, command processor, 1553B bus manager, housekeeping data manager,   
SSDR manager, downlink manager, autonomy functions, and maintenance functions.
Highlights of these software processes are described in the following         
paragraphs. Functional differences between the active (1553B bus controller)  
and backup (1553B bus remote terminal) CTPs are described in the section on   
the bus manager.                                                              
                                                                              
Executive                                                                     
All C&DH software functions are scheduled with respect to the eight minor     
frames, each driven by an 8-Hz hardware interrupt that also provides a marker 
to define the 1-s major frame boundary. The executive is an interrupt service 
routine that responds to every                                                
8-Hz interrupt, increments minor frame count, and maintains MET in seconds.   
All subordinate software routines are scheduled with respect to minor frames 0
through 7. This scheduled polling approach for C&DH functions eliminates the  
need for multitasking and additional interrupts, and it also results in a     
simple deterministic design that can be readily tested. Functions are allocate
by minor frame to ensure that processor use is distributed among tasks; stress
testing under maximum load conditions verified that peak processor use within 
any single 125-ms minor frame is 73 ms. Upon initial power-up or reset of the 
CTP, the executive executes a number of self-test and initialization functions
before enabling the interrupt to start the minor frame schedule.              
                                                                              
Uplink Processor                                                              
CTP uplink hardware decodes received telecommand transfer frames and buffers  
the binary data in first-in first-out memory. The uplink manager controls that
interface and reads up to four buffered data bytes in each minor frame,       
performs additional decoding, and detects when a full transfer frame has been 
received from either of the redundant uplink decoders. Any transmission error 
detected by the above logic is signaled to ground via the CCSDS status word   
reported in downlink telemetry frames. If the received data have no           
transmission errors, and if the frame has the expected sequence number and    
contains commands that meet validity checks, the commands are extracted from  
the frame and passed to the command processing task. Upon receipt of each     
valid command, the uplink manager also resets a software-controlled CTP RF    
watchdog timer that will time out if not reset within a commandable time      
interval (from 1 h to 12 days), thereby triggering a stored command sequence  
that autonomously switches the uplink hardware to the redundant side.         
                                                                              
Command Processor                                                             
Command processing entails handling real-time commands received from the      
uplink, managing storage of command sequences in C&DH memory, and dispatching 
pending commands based on a priority scheme. Real-time command packets        
containing an operation code targeting one of the NEAR instruments or the     
attitude interface unit are routed to the 1553B bus manager for delivery to   
that subsystem. Commands destined for the C&DH software are processed directly
by the command processor; such commands include control and mode options      
associated with the various C&DH functions. Some C&DH commands support        
definition of autonomy rules and upload of command sequences (macros) to be   
stored in memory for later execution. The command processor also accepts data 
load command and, via a hardware serial data interface, delivers control bits 
to the SSDRs, command detector units and telemetry conditioning units (none of
which is accessible via the 1553B data bus). Last, relay commands are dis-    
patched by controlling a hardware interface with the power switching unit.    
Command manager software prepares a command history and error status that is  
stored in memory for diagnostic use.                                          
Once per minor frame, the queue of pending commands is examined and the       
command with the highest source priority is executed. The source priority, in 
high-to-low order, is real-time command, spacecraft separation sequence, macro
triggered by safing autonomy rule, macro triggered by housekeeping autonomy   
rule, a command sent from the attitude interface unit, and a time-tagged macro
scheduled to execute at the current MET. A macro queued for execution is      
processed to completion unless a command from a higher priority source is     
received, at which point the macro is suspended; it resumes once the          
intervening command is completed.                                             
                                                                              
1553B Bus Manager                                                             
A 1553B data bus is the means by which the C&DH software communicates with the
four NEAR instruments, the two redundant attitude interface units, and the    
backup CTP. The primary CTP, which serves as bus controller, knows each of    
these systems as a remote terminal identified by an assigned index. Each      
subsystem contains a 1553B controller chip that arbitrates exchange of data   
via shared memory subdivided into receive subaddresses and transmit           
subaddresses.                                                                 
Bus manager software schedules and controls all of these data exchanges; it   
also manages various internal self tests and retry strategies associated with 
the redundant bus architecture. Software interaction with the bus controller  
chip is managed by delivering control blocks that direct bus activities as    
delineated in a schedule that assigns transactions by minor frame.            
Once per major frame, the bus manager picks up housekeeping data provided by  
each of the remote terminals and provides these data to the housekeeping data 
manager. The bus manager also supports pickup of science or engineering data  
packets from designated subsystems, which are provided to the SSDR manager    
(VC0) or the downlink manager (VC3).Each remote terminal can deliver up to two
VC0 packets per second. Other bus manager functions include distribution of   
MET and a time synchronization message to all remote terminals, as well as    
preparation of bus status statistics maintained for diagnostic use.           
One of the two CTPs is always designated as the backup CTP, which means it    
actually appears to the active CTP as a remote terminal. The C&DH software on 
the backup CTP senses that it is not "active," and its bus manager software   
reverts to a different status, in which it receives commands from the active  
CTP, provides housekeeping and a status message to the active CTP, and receive
MET from the active CTP. The backup CTP can dispatch commands, but it collects
only a subset of the housekeeping data and does not collect or provide packets
to the SSDR or the downlink VCs.                                              
                                                                              
Housekeeping Data Manager                                                     
Once per major frame, housekeeping software concatenates housekeeping data    
collected from all NEAR subsystems and the CTP housekeeping board to create   
the spacecraft housekeeping packet on which autonomy rules operate and which  
is downlinked at a period dependent on telemetry rate and mode. The software  
also prepares the part of the housekeeping packet that contains internal C&DH 
status information. Other data inserted into the housekeeping packet are      
computed telemetry points, which comprise an arithmetic combination of two or 
more collected data elements. Upon receipt of a command to do so, the data    
manager delivers to the SSDR manager a copy of the current housekeeping packet
for storage on the recorder.                                                  
Several bookkeeping functions are provided by data manager software: a stored 
table retains a history of high and low values for all telemetry points;      
snapshots of the housekeeping packets are stored in memory when an error is   
autonomously detected; and various one-bit telltales are maintained to serve  
as indicators of problem conditions. Some of these telltales are "sticky," in 
that they signal an error, and a ground command is required to clear them.    
Solid-State Data Recorder Manager                                             
The recorder manager controls the SSDR hardware interface that accepts data to
be recorded. Once per second,the buffer of accumulated VC0 packets is examined
Sets of three packets are extracted, packaged into a VC0 transfer frame, and  
delivered to the recorder interface. As many as five VC0 transfer frames per  
second are written to the recorder, depending on how ground commands have     
configured remote terminals to deliver packets. To record images, a hardware  
formatter (Fig. 5) interfaces with the Multispectral Imager to read image data
from a high-speed serial line. Because the image bits must be packaged into   
VC2 transfer frames, the SSDR manager task is notified (via the 1553B bus)    
when an image is to be collected; the task then prepares the 184 transfer     
frame wrappers needed by the formatter to encapsulate one image as it is      
delivered to the recorder.                                                    
                                                                              
Downlink Manager                                                              
The downlink manager can be commanded to configure the downlink in any of     
eight transmission rates and five different modes that designate recording    
mode and interleaving of real time (VC3) and SSDR playback (VC1) telemetry    
frames. This flexibility was mandated by mission requirements that vary       
dramatically, depending on mission phase (launch mode, cruise phase,          
at-asteroid operations) and state (safe holds vs. normal operations). The     
downlink manager keeps track of the current transmission rate and builds a    
telemetry transfer frame when the downlink hardware has finished transmitting 
the previous frame. When directed to transmit a frame, the software manages a 
downlink interface that alternates between two buffers at the occurrence of a 
major frame marker. The same interface controls downlink hardware frequency   
and encoding options, as set by ground command sent to the CTP. The downlink  
manager mediates changes to these parameters so that they take effect only on 
telemetry frame boundaries. At the slowest downlink rate, a frame is trans-   
mitted every 896 s; at the fastest rate three frames are transmitted per      
second. Because of the variable frame transmit rate and various interleave    
modes, downlink software incorporates the handshaking necessary for the bus   
manager to notify remote terminals when VC3 packets will go in the downlink in
the following major frame. The C&DH telemetry mode specifies (via command) the
interleaving of VC3 and VC1 frames. In a second in which a VC3 frame is to be 
prepared, the current housekeeping packet is inserted into slot 1 in the      
frame. Slots 2 and 3 are filled with packets collected from designated remote 
terminals. Slots 2 and 3 can also be assigned as memory dump packets, in which
case the downlink manager prepares packets that contain data words read from  
designated C&DH memory locations. The CCSDS frame header and trailer          
(including the status word that alternates between reporting the uplink status
for the two CTPs) are added to the three packets, and the frame is written to 
the downlink buffer. At the higher downlink rates, when more than one VC3     
frame is transmitted per second, the second and third VC3 frames are fill     
frames to avoid reporting of duplicate data.                                  
Similarly, for a 1-s period in which the telemetry mode calls for a VC1 frame 
to be transmitted, downlink software manages the SSDR playback interface to   
read data bytes played from the recorder. One thousand seventy four bytes of  
recorder data are encapsulated in VC1 frame wrappers, and the appropriate     
number of frames is delivered to the downlink buffer.                         
                                                                              
Autonomy Functions                                                            
Autonomous fault detection and correction functions are implemented in the for
of uploadable monitor rules. The autonomy manager maintains 165 rules. Each   
rule identifies one or two telemetry points in the housekeeping packet,       
optional arithmetic or masking operations to be performed on those data, and a
logical compare operation that results in a Boolean flag that is "true" if the
criterion is met for the designated number of consecutive housekeeping packets
When evaluated as true, a rule causes the specified stored command macro to be
queued for execution. Rules are evaluated in priority order, so high-priority 
safing functions take precedence. Commands to the autonomy manager can load or
clear rules, turn individual rules or sets of rules on or off, or disable     
checking of all rules in either of two subsets: safing rules that are stored  
by default upon CTP power-up, or housekeeping rules that are used for less    
critical monitoring functions. The safing rules are the means by which mission
safing modes are implemented. The spacecraft separation sequence, Sun-safe    
mode, Earth-safe mode, power system monitor functions, and attitude interface 
unit monitor functions are all implemented as stored command macros triggered 
by autonomy rules. This rule-based approach to meeting autonomy requirements  
allowed C&DH design to proceed, even when autonomy modes and actions had not  
been fully specified at the mission level. The autonomy manager is basically a
housekeeping checker and rule evaluation engine that queues stored commands.  
This software was thoroughly tested under maximum stress conditions before    
delivery to the spacecraft. Later in the integration phase, the actual mission
rules and macros were installed. What seemed at first to be a simple rule-base
design actually became quite complex when it came to defining the checks and  
command responses needed to coordinate safing for all spacecraft subsystems.  
For example, a rule may trigger a command sequence that in turn disables sets 
of rules and enables others. Mission rule and macro definition was done by the
systems engineering team, which coordinated all subsystems and defined        
cross-subsystem tests. The autonomy manager performs several bookkeeping      
functions to provide data that summarize rule-checking status. An autonomy    
history table is maintained, and a handshake to the data manager and command  
processor ensures that triggered macro commands and housekeeping packet       
snapshots are stored in memory.                                               
                                                                              
Maintenance Functions                                                         
Software maintenance functions are distributed among the minor frame schedule 
as small tasks requiring little processing time. Such functions include       
resetting a watchdog timer that times out if a software error occurs, thereby 
causing a processor reset; stepwise reading of all electronically correctable 
memory to cause the hardware to correct any single-bit errors that may have   
occurred; and computing checksums over blocks of memory so the checksum table 
can be dumped by command to verify that current memory contents match the     
image model maintained by the mission operations team.                        
                                                                              
POWER SWITCHING UNIT                                                          
                                                                              
Power switching for the NEAR spacecraft is a single unit that provides switch 
power and signals for the operation of the spacecraft. The unit is capable of 
64 on/off relay commands. Design of the unit was adapted from similar units   
used on the Midcourse Space Experiment spacecraft.                            
Functional Description                                                        
The unit contains a motherboard and six 18 3 18 cm plug-in cards, two         
driver/telemetry boards, and four relay boards. The boards are mounted in a 23
3 23 3 25 cm chassis. Two types of latching relays provide the various        
switching functions, with each relay selected according to the power          
requirements of the users. Relay contact ratings are 2 and 10 A. In addition, 
2-A nonlatching relays generate high-level pulse commands. The interface      
between the spacecraft power bus and the subsystems is through the two 50-pin 
"D" connectors mounted on each relay board, one for power in and the other for
switched power out. Table 3 lists the characteristics of the power switching  
unit assembly; Table 4 shows the types, contact ratings, and quantities of    
relays.                                                                       
                                                                              
Circuit Description                                                           
The two driver/telemetry boards provide redundant relay coil drive and relay  
contact position telemetry. Relay drive circuits are configured in an 8 3 8   
matrix. Each driver/telemetry board accepts an 8-bit parallel command word    
from one of the two command processors and decodes the command into the       
appropriate signal to operate the relays.The driver/telemetry boards also     
contain parallel-to-serial shift registers with output interfaces for         
telemetering the relay contact positions. All latching relays are monitored.  
The telemetry data stream one from each driver/telemetry board, supplies data 
to one of the redundant CTPs. All command decoding and telemetry logic is     
implemented with CD4000B series integrated circuits. Relay coil drive circuits
use discrete transistors.                                                     
                                                                              
Power Requirements                                                            
The unit operates with a nominal 128-V and a                                  
15-V input to each driver/telemetry board. The                                
128-V power, supplied by the spacecraft battery, operates the command decoding
and relay coil drive circuitry. The 15-V power operates the telemetry circuits
                                                                              
FLIGHT COMPUTER                                                               
The NEAR flight computer is a Honeywell model HSC-E, which is a three-slice   
assembly consisting of two independent processor slices and a dual-power      
converter as the middle slice. Figure 6 is a composite photograph of the      
flight hardware chassis and circuit boards, with a summary of attributes. The 
HSC-E occupies less than 3770 cm3 and weighs 5 kg. One processor and one-half 
of the dual-power converter constitute a computer element called a string.    
The two strings can be operated simultaneously, or one can be active and one  
can be in standby (hot or cold) mode. Each string operates from a 128-V       
source, drawing, nominally, 8 W. Each processor slice contains a generic very 
high-speed integrated circuit spaceborne computer (GVSC), 512,000 words of    
static random access memory, 16,000 words of start-up read-only memory,       
256,000 words of EEPROM, and input/output (I/O).                              
The central processing unit function consists of a GVSC chip set and associate
processor support logic. The GVSC chip set implements the MIL-STD-1750A6      
instruction set. Processor support logic is implemented in a gate array with  
the I/O control functions. All memory access goes through the GVSC memory     
management unit and block protect unit. The memory management unit maps       
logical addresses to physical addresses in 4000 pages via 16 sets of page     
registers and provides lock and key protection for 4000 blocks of memory to   
prevent unauthorized accesses. The HSC-E processor supports four              
I/O interfaces: 1553B, serial I/O, parallel I/O, and a test port.             
                                                                              
PRE-INTEGRATION TESTING AND TESTBED SIMULATOR                                 
The NEAR C&DH system consists of five chassis assemblies that are structurally
and thermally attached to spacecraft honeycomb panels and powered by the 128-V
bus. Each item received comprehensive stand-alone testing and a formal pre-   
integration review of test results before it was installed on the spacecraft. 
These tests included                                                          
o       Full functional test at ambient conditions                            
o       Hot and cold temperature tests in air                                 
o       Powered 3-axis sinusoidal and random vibration tests                  
o       Hot and cold soaks and temperature cycles in thermal vacuum           
Additional compatibility tests were performed to verify all of the interfaces 
shown in Fig. 1. These tests involved connecting the breadboard CTP to        
prototypes of the other units one at a time. To prove the interfaces, commands
were sent, telemetry verified, 1553B bus traffic analyzed, waveforms confirmed
etc. This effort led to well-understood interfaces and exceptionally trouble- 
free spacecraft integration.                                                  
Software testing of the RTX2010 microprocessor code in the CTP was initially  
performed by the development team. Additional independent validation and      
verification testing was done by an outside contractor. Finally, a testbed    
simulator for the ground station evolved from an early command and telemetry  
test between the CTP and the spacecraft electrical ground support equipment.  
The breadboards and CTP bench test equipment were preserved for use by the    
NEAR mission operations team. The team uses this local testbed to try out     
operational commands and memory loads and to connect various exercises with   
prototype instruments and the SSDR.                                           
Test sets were developed specifically for each of the flight units previously 
discussed. The most elaborate of the test sets is the CTP bench test equipment
This equipment was custom designed for the NEAR CTP by Telenetics, Inc., in   
Columbia, Maryland. Its scope was established by the need to drive every CTP  
input and to monitor every CTP output under closed-loop control by a computer.
Telenetics implemented this bench test equipment with off-the-shelf VME-based 
modules augmented by custom-designed interface boards where necessary. The    
control software was written in C language and runs on a 486 PC under the OS2 
operating system. Originally planned as a hardware tester, the flexibility of 
the design lent itself to expanding requirements during CTP development. This 
bench test equipment became the platform for independent validation and       
verification testing of the CTP software. Its capability for negative testing,
such as sending a deliberately bad command message and seeing that it is      
rejected, was used extensively during these tests. The bench test equipment is
now incorporated into the testbed simulator that is used routinely by the NEAR
mission operations team.                                                      
                                                                              
CONCLUSION                                                                    
                                                                              
The NEAR CTPs and power switching unit were designed, fabricated, and tested a
APL. Schedule and cost constraints from the NASA Discovery program dictated a 
"keep it simple" approach and the use of design heritage as much as possible. 
The outside contracts with SEAKR Engineering and Honeywell were closely       
monitored by APL staff with many years of technical and contract management   
experience. The C&DH software was developed by a three-person team that define
unit tests and an acceptance test procedure using bench test equipment that   
could simulate spacecraft subsystems. The preliminary build of C&DH software  
was delivered to the spacecraft for integration in June 1995, 9 months after  
the software requirements were signed off (Artis7). The CTPs were loaded with 
new C&DH software a total of 22 times during integration and test and prior to
launch. Eight of these revisions incorporated a minor code change; all other  
revisions incorporated an updated set of default mission autonomy rules and   
stored macros. After a full year in cruise mode and a flyby of the asteroid   
Mathilde, NEAR operations experience has shown the success of the C&DH        
implementation.
