  DESCRIPTION         = "This provides an overview of the entire NEAR mission"
  ABSTRACT_TEXT       = "The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission    
    inaugurates NASA's Discovery Program. It will be the first to orbit an    
    asteroid and will make the first comprehensive scientific measurements of 
    an asteroid's surface composition, geology, physical properties, and      
    internal structure. NEAR was launched successfuly on 17 February 1996     
    aboard a Delta II-7925. It made the first reconnaissance of a C-type      
    asteroid during its flyby of the main-belt asteroid 253 Mathilde in June  
    1997 and will orbit the unusually large near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros for a
    year at a minimum orbit of about 35 km from the center of the asteroid.   
    NEAR will obtain new information on the nature and evolution of asteroids,
    improve our understanding of planetary formation processes in the early   
    solar system, and clarify the relationship between asteroids and          
    meteorites. The NEAR Mission Operations Center and Science Data Center are
    both located at APL. The latter will maintain the entire NEAR data set    
    on-line and will make data from all instruments accessible over the       
    Internet to every member of the NEAR science team."
