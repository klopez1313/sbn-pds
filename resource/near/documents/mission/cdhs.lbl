  ABSTRACT_TEXT       = "The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) data       
  data handling (C&DH) system is designed to manage complex operations and to 
collect data when the spacecraft is out of contact with ground control. During
ground contacts, the C&DH system accepts uplink commands and memory loads that
describe a time-ordered set of events to follow, and it transmits previously  
recorded data back to the ground station. This article describes the overall  
C&DH system, gives details on each of the components, and tells how the system
was tested prior to spacecraft integration. Solid-state data recorders and    
flight computers are also discussed."
