        definition - Barycentric Dynamical Time corresponding to MET(1).      
     Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) is the independent                      
     variable in the equations, including terms for relativity,               
     of motion of the celestial bodies.  The solution of these                
     equations gives the rectangular coordinates of those                     
     bodies relative to the barycentre (centre of mass) of the                
     solar system.  (The barycentre does not coincide with the                
     centre of the Sun but is displaced to a point near its                   
     surface in the direction of Jupiter.)

        definition - calibrate the A/D converter - the A/D converter in the   
                     magnetometer electronics has a calibration mode which    
                     should be exercised periodically by command.  When the   
                     DPU receives the "calibrate A/D" command, it finishes    
                     building the current science record and queues it for    
                     transmission, then sets the "calibrate A/D" bit in its   
                     interface to the magnetometer.  While the A/D performs   
                     an internal calibration (at least two 20 Hz magnetometer 
                     cycles), the DPU discards the garbage serial data which  
                     the magnetometer sends.  At the end of the calibration,  
                     the DPU resets the "calibrate A/D bit" and then resumes  
                     normal data collection from the magnetometer on the      
                     following cycle.

        definition - time tag - the science housekeeping consists of the real-
                     time housekeeping (except for the magnetic field sample) 
                     and a time tag.  The housekeeping is sampled at the start
                     of science record collection.  The time tag indicates the
                     time of the first magnetometer data sample in the science
                     record, and provides more accuracy than the time tag in  
                     the packet header.  The time tag is the delta time, in   
                     secs./20, of the first sample from the 1 sec. time tag in
                     the packet header.  Since the 20 Hz magnetometer clock is
                     independent of the spacecraft 1 Hz clock                 
                     that provides the MET, the time tag may be incorrect by  
                     up to 1/20 of a second. The "calibrate A/D" bit indicates
                     that an A/D calibration was done just before this science
                     record was collected.  Since calibrating the A/D causes  
                     data collection from the magnetometer to be suspended, a 
                     time discontinuity is propagated through the data        
                     processing stages; thus, the data in the science record  
                     should be regarded with suspicion.

        definition - noise/range0-noise/range43 - A series of 44 noise reject 
                     indicators and ranges are contained in each science      
                     record. Each noise reject indicator and three-bit range  
                     is packed into a four-bit field; the noise reject is in  
                     the msb and the range is in the lsbs.  The record is     
                     padded with 48 bits to fill a NEAR CCSDS packet. This    
                     data is collected during a consistent magnetometer state 
                     which is recorded and sent with the sampled magnetic     
                     field data.  To ensure the consistency of the state, the 
                     DPU delays processing commands that effect the state unti
                     after the current record is complete.  If processing is  
                     aborted by the Abort Science Record command or by        
                     commanding the magnetometer power off, the aborted record
                     will have a flag set and unfilled data slots will have   
                     zeros. This flag indicates whether the noise filter      
                     identified any internal instrument magnetometer samples  
                     for rejection that were used to obtain the current       
                     science field values.  This flag is set whether the noise
                     rejection is on or off.
