  DESCRIPTION              = "The SDC_PROC file contains the codes            
      used for reading Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) data files              
      produced by the Science Data Center (SDC), extracting the               
      pertinent magnetometer, command telemetry processors (CTP),             
      and housekeeping data, and producing plots and data files               
      for the NEAR MAG experiment.  The files generated by these              
      codes are used as input to another software package                     
      SCI_PROC, which is also included on this volume.                        
                                                                              
      The main functions of  the software package are: open and read HDF      
      files, apply corrections to the data, produce plots and ASCII data      
      files.                                                                  
                                                                              
      The corrections applied include:                                        
        1. Range offset.                                                      
        2. Magnetometer internal time latency.                                
        3. Temperature.
