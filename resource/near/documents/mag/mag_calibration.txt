Calibration of NEAR Magnetometer Data                                         
                                                                              
Calibration of the magnetometer data consisted of two major                   
steps.  The first step was to evaluate the basic sensor                       
response to the known field in the pre-flight environment.                    
The second step was to evaluate the sensor alignments and                     
spacecraft field in the in-flight environment.  The details                   
of these steps have been described by Lohr et al. [1997] and                  
Anderson et al. [2001], respectively.   Here we present a                     
brief summary of the results from these publications.  The                    
software packages, mag_sdc_proc.doc and mag_sci_proc.doc,  used               
for data reduction have been included as an example of an                     
algorithm for the data reduction methodology.                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
1.  Pre-flight results                                                        
                                                                              
The pre-flight calibration evaluated the linearity,                           
orthogonality and cross talk of the sensor block for each                     
axis and each dynamic range.  Table 1 shows the list of the                   
linearity tests performed for ranges 7 through 3 at GSFC and                  
for ranges 7 through 0 at APL.  Pre-flight sensor                             
calibration provided absolute gain calibrations to 0.1%                       
(0.5%) in the least (most) sensitive range and orientation                    
to 1 arc minute.

In-flight data, including those acquired during the Earth                     
swing-by of January 22-23, 1998, were used to obtain the                      
gain factors and the precise sensor orientation.  From                        
comparison of the measured and IGRF-1995 model magnetic                       
fields for the swing-by period, the final adjustment matrix                   
in the spacecraft coordinates was determined to be:

To obtain the final vector fields (Bx, By, Bz)Final-SC, one                   
converts the raw data (counts) from each sensor using the                     
conversion factors defined in Table 1, removes spacecraft                     
fields described in the following section to obtain (Bx, By,                  
Bx)Obs-SC, and then use the matrix operation defined in                       
Equation (1).                                                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
2.2.  Spacecraft fields                                                       
                                                                              
The spacecraft fields evaluated after launch are summarized                   
in Table 2, which is taken from Anderson et al. [2001].                       
The following is a brief description of the sources of                        
spacecraft fields.                                                            
                                                                              
2.2.1. Magnetic latching valves                                               
                                                                              
The static magnetic field is due mostly to the magnetic                       
latching valves used in the propulsion system.  The field                     
was reduced to less than 200 nT by placing two permanent                      
magnets on the top deck.  Long-term cruise measurements                       
determined the field to an accuracy of 0.5 nT.                                
                                                                              
2.2.2. Terminal board                                                         
                                                                              
All loads on the spacecraft are powered through the terminal                  
board.  The wiring makes an uncompensated current loop of                     
100 cm**2 to 600 cm**2 and produces variable magnetic fields.                 
The total magnitude of the field is 30 to 50 nT and changes                   
stepwise.                                                                     
                                                                              
2.2.3. Power management system                                                
                                                                              
The power system includes the solar arrays and cabling, and                   
the power shunt control circuitry.  The total array counts                    
ranges from 15 to 60 amperes giving a variation in the                        
observed field as large as 38 nT.  This variation is                          
corrected to a precision of about 1.5 nT in each component                    
by using the following relationship between the solar array                   
current and the field variations, where one ampere equals                     
3.4 counts.                                                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
    | delta BX |   |  -0.020 +/- 0.011 |

Current shunting is done in two levels, digital (stepwise)                    
and analog (continuous) [Jenkins et al., 1995].  It is                        
possible to remove the contamination fields from the                          
currents because both the total solar array currents and                      
digital and analog shunt currents are recorded.                               
                                                                              
2.2.4.  Momentum wheels                                                       
                                                                              
Four momentum wheels are included in the spacecraft attitude                  
control system for three-axis stabilization and precision                     
pointing.  The wheels produces sinusoidal signals with ~1 nT                  
peak to peak amplitude.  The contamination from the wheels                    
can be avoided by filtering out the rapid variation.
