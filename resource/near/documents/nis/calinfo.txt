The CALIB/ directory contains sixteen calibration tables with detached        
PDS labels.  The NIS calibration procedure, NISCAL, uses these file to        
convert from raw NIS output (DN) to radiance.                                 
                                                                              
The description fields in the label files, together with (1) the              
calibration documents in DOCUMENT/, (2) the Niscal manual                     
DOCUMENT/NISCALSW/MANUAL.TXT, (3) the comments in the Niscal IDL procedures   
in DOCUMENT/NISCALSW/, and (4) the NIS instrument catalog                     
CATALOG/NISINST.CAT, all combine to give detailed explanations of the         
tables and their values' significance.
