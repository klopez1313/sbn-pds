 The Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIS) instrument will map the spectral prop-  
erties of asteroid 433 Eros in the range 800-2600 nm to determine its mineral 
content. Optically, NIS uses a scan mirror and an imaging mirror to project   
an image at a field stop. A grating spectrometer disperses the energy, and    
a dichroic beamsplitter separates two spectral orders, reflecting the short   
wavelengths (816-1500 nm) to a 32-element Ge detector, and transmitting the   
long wavelengths (1500-2600 nm) to a 32-element InGaAs detector. The spectral 
resolutions are 22 and 44 nm for the second and first spectral orders,        
respectively. A scan mirror rotates the field of view over a 140 degree range 
that includes a solar-illuminated calibration target. Spectra are measured    
at 1 Hz using a selection of data acquisition macros. The properties of the   
instrument were extensively measured during on-ground calibration, and        
in-flight calibration was begun shortly after launch. The NIS will observe    
Eros during approach to the asteroid and will produce composition maps of the 
entire illuminated surface at spatial resolutions as high as  300 m.
