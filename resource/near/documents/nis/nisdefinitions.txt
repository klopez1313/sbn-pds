     Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) is the independent                      
     variable in the equations, including terms for relativity,               
     of motion of the celestial bodies.  The solution of these                
     equations gives the rectangular coordinates of those                     
     bodies relative to the barycentre (centre of mass) of the                
     solar system.  (The barycentre does not coincide with the                
     centre of the Sun but is displaced to a point near its                   
     surface in the direction of Jupiter.)

        Ge detector temperatures have a caveat:                               
        only 8 bits of the 12 bit data are sent to the ground, with the 8 bits
        taken out of the middle. Therefore when the temperature reaches a     
        maximum value the data rolls over and starts again near the minimum.  
        If the scale isn't adjusted a temperature of just above -30C can      
        appear as around -110C.
