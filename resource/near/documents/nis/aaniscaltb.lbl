These files are used by the IDL program Niscal to calibrate NIS data from     
from raw counts to radiance factor.  They have not been changed from their    
original format except that they now have tabs replaced with spaces           
carriage returns added at the end of each line to conform to PDS              
standards.   Also, many of these files have lines longer than 78              
characters.  Therefore, they may display in a strange                         
fashion, cause display corruption or cause unexpected behavior when opened    
using standard editors on some computers.  As such, they were only meant      
for use with the IDL version of NISCAL in a  Unix(tm) environment.  PDS       
versions of these files as ASCII Tables are available in the CALIB/           
directory on this volume; the PDS labels in that directory explain the        
contents of each file and its purpose in the calibration procedure.
