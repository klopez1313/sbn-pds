1. Introduction                                                               
                                                                              
This document provides an overview of the Near Earth Asteroid                 
Rendezvous X-Ray Level 2 Observation Log archive.  These documents            
describe the systems that were used to command and control the                
spacecraft during times when XGRS was controlling attitude, as                
well as commands that were used to configure the instrumentation              
during the orbital encounter.

Three types of files are included in this directory:                          
                                                                              
a. XGRS_COMMAND_DESC.*    Describes the Observation Log macro names           
                          and configuration parameters.                       
                                                                              
b. XGRS_INST_USER_GUIDE4* Commanding and CAS generation for                   
                           instrument and commanding of spacecraft.           
                           Lists formats and other higher level               
                           issues for team members to build                   
                           instrument control macros.                         
                                                                              
c. XGRS_OBSLOG*           Actual Observation Log of dates and times           
                           of command macros that were executed by            
                           the spacecraft and instrument systems.             
                                                                              
Also included are label files for each file type.
