NEAR Laser Rangefinder: A Tool for the Mapping and Topologic Study of Asteroid
433 Eros

In 1999, after a 3-year transit through space, the Near Earth Asteroid        
Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft will place a scientific payload consisting of    
five instruments into a low-altitude orbit ( 35 km) about the asteroid 433    
Eros for 1 year. One instrument, the NEAR Laser Rangefinder (NLR), will use   
infrared laser pulses to provide astrophysicists with precision altimetry data
measurements that were previously unavailable from asteroid observations.     
These data will accurately map Eros's topology, identify and characterize     
small-scale surface features, a precisely determine overall volume and mass   
once they are combined with navigation data. Objectives associated with the   
NLR science mission are presented along with performance specifications and   
instrument design details. The method by which NLR performance was analyzed is
described, as are tests us to verify its performance and operability. During  
performance testing, an "end-to-end" test was conducted, where the integrated 
NLR instrument was operated in free space using a 216.4-m hallway. Test       
results fully verified all instrument interfaces and indicated that NLR per-  
formance parameters were well within all specifications. In addition, range   
noise and biases were repeatable to 1 count, which is the minimum level       
possible for a direct-detection rangefinder.

INTRODUCTION                                                                  
On 17 February 1996, NASA's first Discovery mission began as the Delta II     
rocket rose from complex 17B carrying the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous      
(NEAR) spacecraft. The overall NEAR mission objective is to provide           
information about the origin and nature of near-Earth asteroids, whose        
characteristics are suspected to provide clues about the formation of the     
inner planets, including the Earth, and whose composition is reflective of    
material as it existed soon after the "big bang." Interest in asteroids has   
been further heightened by the realization of their potential for terrestrial 
impacts; the Earth's geologic record contains evidence of many such events,   
including the cataclysmic collision that occurred some 65 million years ago.  
Astrophysicists have derived their knowledge of asteroids from Earth-based    
observations, distant spacecraft flybys, and analyses of meteorites. From this
data, a framework was developed to theoretically model asteroidal dynamics,   
structure, and thermal evolution.Indeed, sizes and shapes of asteroids contain
important clues about their thermal, collisional, and dynamic histories and   
their internal structures. The NEAR mission offers an opportunity to          
dramatically improve our understanding of asteroids by gathering data in close
proximity to one. In addition to gathering data typical of previous           
observations, the NEAR mission will obtain asteroid data never possible before
data whose gathering requires close-range operation such as high-precision    
altimetry.                                                                    
High-precision altimetry data will contribute significant insight to asteroid 
evolution by describing surface characteristics and global parameters such as 
volume and mass. The altimeter instrument, the NEAR Laser Rangefinder (NLR),  
is designed to operate continuously throughout the 1-year orbit and to produce
precision altimetry data over altitudes <327 km from Eros's surface. This     
laser altimeter detects round-trip time, or time of flight (TOF), using a     
high-power pulsed laser with precise (2.08-ns resolution) timing measurements,
which provides range resolution of 32 cm. With on-board calibration capability
and from instrument-level tests prior to launch, the NLR range accuracy is    
also 32 cm.                                                                   
The target asteroid is 433 Eros, one of the largest and most intensively      
studied near-Earth asteroids. Astrophysicists have estimated Eros to be 10-20 
km in size, with a rotational period of roughly 5.27 h and an albedo of 0.15. 
Available Earth-based observations1 indicate that Eros is a highly elliptical 
body measuring 36   15   13 km. These data, however, do not rule out the      
possibility that Eros may actually be a "rubble pile" consisting of two or    
more small, gravitationally bound bodies. Figure 1 illustrates the geometry   
involved for NEAR. The instruments continually observe Eros by attitude       
rotation. The rotation plane is constrained by the requirements to maintain   
solar arrays, which are mechanically fixed, facing toward the Sun and to keep 
the high-gain antenna within an acceptable angle of Earth's position.         
The NLR design approach is described in this article. The approach used to    
analyze the operating performance of the altimeter is presented, and results  
from this analysis are summarized. To validate the NLR design and to ensure   
its successful operation subsequent to launch and exposure to deep space over 
a total period of 4 years, several instrument-level and integration tests     
were devised and performed. These included an operational test of the NLR to  
verify correct system operation "end-to-end" and to characterize instrument   
bias and performance. End-to-end testing also provided information            
associated with operational peculiarities of the NLR and was vital to the     
check-out of the instrument's interface to the spacecraft.                    
MISSION SPECIFICATIONS                                                        
The objective of the NEAR laser ranging investigation is to obtain accurate,  
high-resolution altimetry measurements that can be correlated with navigation 
and gravity data to provide quantitative insight into the internal structure, 
rotational dynamics, and evolution of Eros. According to Dr. Maria Zuber, the 
NLR science team leader, NEAR altimetry data and orbital tracking data will   
allow the volume and mass of Eros to be estimated to a precision of 0.01% and 
0.0001%, respectively. Comparison between the NLR-derived data set and the    
predetermined gravity field (estimated from Eros's shape and spacecraft orbit 
perturbations) will permit correlation of surface topography to the local     
gravity field. Although the mean density measurement will be limited by the   
accuracy of our topographic field, resultant volume and mass values can be    
estimated with an accuracy significantly improved over that for any other     
asteroid previously observed.                                                 
Specifications for the NLR were derived from NLR mission requirements and     
spacecraft constraints. To provide the desired volume and mass measurement    
precision, single-shot altimetry resolution and accuracy relative to the      
asteroid center of mass must not exceed 6 m. For small-scale topology,        
altimetry sample density (spacing between altimetry measurements on Eros's    
surface) must be almost contiguous along the direction of the subsatellite    
track on the asteroid. Over the range of spacecraft altitudes expected with   
a spacecraft velocity of 5 m/s relative to Eros, the sampling density will    
be more than adequate given the altimeter firing rate of 1 Hz and a laser     
transmitter divergence of 235 mrad. Figure 2 illustrates the extreme          
expected orbit geometries and resulting sampling densities. In addition to    
the sampling density along the track, global parameter estimation requires    
that the cross-track resolution, the spatial resolution perpendicular to the  
subsatellite tracks, must be  500 m. Cross-track resolution is governed by    
orbit-to-orbit separation and orbit (NLR) mission duration; therefore, it     
was not considered a direct requirement for the NLR instrument.               
All NLR measurements will be registered in an absolute center-of-mass         
reference frame, allowing precise registration with data from other NEAR      
sensors. Any offset between center of mass and center of figure for the       
asteroid will be determined by correlating gravity with topography data. The  
offset will reveal whether internal density differences are uniformly         
distributed and will help verify if Eros consists of two or more              
gravitationally bound bodies. Table 1 summarizes the requirements for the     
NLR based on NLR science objectives and on estimated characteristics          
associated with Eros.                                                         
NLR SYSTEM DESIGN: A MODULAR APPROACH                                         
To meet the accelerated schedule for the NEAR program, the NLR was developed  
as a modular system (Fig. 3). We selected a bistatic configuration, which     
permitted parallel development of the transmitter and receiver. The NLR       
instrument operates by transmitting laser pulses to the asteroid surface and  
measuring the TOF between outgoing light energy and optical energy back-      
scatter from the asteroid surface toward the receiver. This direct-detection  
approach uses leading-edge detection based on Neyman Pearson thresholding,    
thereby greatly simplifying wave form processing requirements. Not only are   
leading-edge altimeters relatively simple to implement, but the approach      
reduces range scintillation generated when the extent of the target range     
exceeds the transmitted pulse width, a condition that could be encountered    
when mapping irregular surfaces of an asteroid.                               
Basic Subsystems and Operation                                                
The NLR required 19 months to develop, from start of design through completion
of flight qualification. The transmitter and receiver units were developed and
tested separately; subsystems were tested prior to integration using National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable equipment. Although    
schedule constraints precluded fabrication of brassboard models,breadboard and
engineering models were produced and used extensively to debug design and     
packaging issues.                                                             
A block diagram of the NLR instrument (Fig. 4) shows its five subsystems: the 
laser transmitter subassembly with a fiber-optic delay assembly (FODA) and    
laser power supply (LPS); the optical receiver; the analog electronics with a 
detector, processor boards, and a medium-voltage power supply (MVPS); the     
digital processing unit (DPU); and the low-voltage power supply (LVPS). Red   
lines in Fig. 4 indicate the optical paths for laser signals; red words       
indicate the primary signals for the electronics. The optical receiver,       
analog electronics, LVPS, MVPS, and DPU are collectively referred to as the   
NLR receiver. The receiver was designed, fabricated, and tested at APL. The   
transmitter was obtained through subcontract from McDonnell Douglas Aerospace 
Corp. The transmitter, once completed and qualified by McDonnell Douglas      
Aerospace Corp., was delivered to APL for final integration and acceptance    
testing at the instrument level.The integrated NLR instrument was subsequently
tested and subsequently flight qualified at both instrument and spacecraft    
levels.                                                                       
NLR operation is described by Fig. 4. The measurement sequence begins with a  
"Fire" command issued by the DPU at a selected pulse repetition frequency.This
command enables the transmitter, which fires a 15-ns optical pulse toward the 
asteroid and simultaneously directs a portion of this pulse into the FODA for 
calibration TOF purposes. A photodiode at the transmitter output detects the  
laser pulse and sends an electronic START signal command to both of the       
receiver gallium arsenide (GaAs) TOF counters (range and calibration).        
As a result, during operation, the NLR receiver should see two optical pulses 
per transmitted pulse. The first, arriving 558 ns after the laser fires, is a 
calibration pulse routed through the fixed delay provided by the FODA.        
Detection of this pulse by the receiver halts the calibration TOF counter.The 
second return is the optical backscatter from the asteroid, which halts the   
range counter. To minimize noise, received optical signals are compared with  
a threshold level set either by ground command or through an auto-acquisition 
(calibration) sequence. After both TOF counters are stopped, the DPU reads the
counter values and formats their contents (and other data) into NLR science   
data packets for transmission over the 1553 bus,as requested by the spacecraft
data collection process. Consequently, what is measured is elapsed time       
between the START indication from the laser and the arrival of STOP signals as
produced within the receiver. Terms used in Fig. 4 are defined and described  
in subsequent sections. The figure also illustrates the electrical interface  
between the spacecraft and the instrument. (Heater control and receiver door  
release circuits are not shown.)                                              
NLR Transmitter                                                               
The laser resonator assembly (LRA) is a solid-state laser based on a proven   
polarization-coupled U-cavity design2 (Fig. 5). The gain medium is a Cr:Nd:YAG
zigzag slab, side-pumped at 809 nm using a 20-element gallium arsenide (GaAs) 
diode array (having thermal sensitivity of Dl/DT = 1 nm/4 C) with a peak power
of 620 W in a pulse width of 200 ms. The opposite side of the slab is coupled 
to a heat sink for thermal control. An antireflection coating applied to the  
long dimension of the slab improves pump-power coupling efficiency, and a high
reflectance coating on the heat-sink side reflects pump energy back into the  
slab. This zigzag pumping yields a uniform distribution of optical energy     
throughout the gain medium, increasing absorption path length and conversion  
efficiency.                                                                   
An antireflection coating at both slab end faces reduces optical losses for   
rotated polarization states. A quarter-wave plate placed after the slab end   
face maintains polarization. The gain medium is located in a cross-porro      
cavity to provide boresight stability; a Risley wedge in each porro prism     
assembly permits cavity alignment during assembly. An internal aperture       
reduces higher-order modes, and a 9.3  Galilean telescope acts as an external 
beam expander to reduce angular divergence. (Output beam divergence was       
specified as  300 mrad; our final divergence, in vacuum, is 235 mrad.)        
The laser operates at 1.064 mm and is Q-switched for pulsed-mode operation    
using a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) Pockels cell. A half-wave plate provides     
polarization compensation. Placement of the Q-switch in the output segment of 
the beam path minimizes the potential for optical damage to the crystal by    
locating it within the low circulating power portion of the resonator. Because
LiNbO3 is pyroelectric, thermal gradients must be controlled during operation 
in vacuum environments. For this reason, the NLR has redundant operational and
survival heater circuits to reduce thermal variations to 22 to 14 C of the    
thermal set point.                                                            
To provide thermal isolation, the LRA is mounted to the NLR housing using     
Vespel shoulder washers. Figure 6 is a photograph of the actual LRA assembly  
depicting the laser and associated resonator optics. Note the lightweight 9.3 
output optic. Mechanical interface for the LRA uses a three-point kinematic   
mounting configuration.                                                       
Table 2 presents specifications for the NLR. Also presented are measurements  
(and estimates) for each of these values.The laser transmitter was extensively
characterized as part of the NLR instrument test sequence. The system reliably
produced 15-ns (60.82 ns) optical pulses each having 15.3 mJ (62 mJ) energy.  
This optical pulse was coupled to the FODA and was measured at the LRA output 
coupler as 7.2 pJ. (All power measurements used NIST-traceable power meters   
accurate to 65%). Prelaunch NLR testing demonstrated that the NLR passed all  
specifications.                                                               
The output beam was characterized using a fast (picosecond response) detector 
to detail the longitudinal mode structure (Fig. 7). Characterization of the   
near field included measurement of beam diameter (defined where amplitude     
decreases to 1/e2 of maximum), modal structure, and energy distribution.      
Far-field testing consisted of beam divergence, jitter, and wander. Divergence
significantly affects the science data through surface sampling size. This    
parameter was measured in both air (ambient,at 135 mrad) and vacuum (235 mrad)
(Fig. 8). Gaussian correlation coefficients along both the x and y axes were  
0.91;therefore, performance was better than the specified 0.90. The difference
in divergence is related to output telescope alignment with and without       
atmosphere. Although the index of refraction changes by only 3 parts in       
10,000,3 it was enough in a high-power optic using air-gap spacing to make a  
measurable difference in the wavefront shaping.                               
The LPS provides the control logic and power necessary to enable and fire the 
LRA. The LPS also provides the 190-ms pump current (45 A) to the diode array. 
hybrid component develops the 12800 V necessary to operate the Q-switch. Upon 
receiving a "Fire" command from the DPU, the LPS uses a signal from the NLR   
logic within the DPU to begin charging the storage capacitors that produce the
diode drive current. To reduce noise coupling to the receiver during expected 
arrival of laser backscatter, the switching DC/DC converter within the LPS is 
disabled for the maximum ranging distance (327 km). Subsequent to maximum TOF,
the LPS is enabled to prepare for the next pulse.                             
NLR Receiver                                                                  
The NLR receiver design uses a lightweight Cassegrain telescope, a spectral   
filter (centered at the laser wavelength), a single-element avalanche photo-  
diode (APD) hybrid detector, amplification filtering, voltage biasing and     
thresholding circuitry, and appropriate power supplies (1550 V DC for the APD 
from the MVPS and 615 V DC and 65 V DC from the LVPS). The receiver design    
was based on previous APL APD-based detection circuit designs and on APL      
developments in TOF systems using high-speed (2 GHz) GaAs applications-       
specific integrated circuitry (ASIC).                                         
A significant aspect of our configuration is that the NLR receiver optics act 
a direct-detection "photon bucket." This approach drastically simplified the  
design and development of the optical receiver because the system is not      
required to produce an image. Consequently, the optics could tolerate high    
levels of aberrations as long as the resultant spot size remained within the  
physical and alignment bounds of the APD detector. This gave us the freedom   
to select the receiver optical design best suited for low weight and          
manufacturing ease, specifically, an f/3.4 Dall Kirkham design (Fig. 9).      
Our telescope is a two-mirror aluminum Dall Kirkham arrangement using an      
athermal design. The primary mirror is 3.5 in. (8.89 cm) (see Fig. 9) with an 
overall field of view of 3 mrad. The Dall Kirkham layout is simple to         
manufacture but suffers primarily from coma arising from off-axis light.      
However, since the NLR operates with paraxial light, comatic aberration is    
minimal and does not influence the performance of the receiver.               
Since there are no bright sources near the NLR line of sight when viewing     
Eros, specifications of surface roughness for the aluminum mirrors were       
relaxed; we used diamond-turned surfaces, which are relatively inexpensive for
the mechanical and optical quality provided. No superpolishing was required;  
only antioxidant layer was deposited onto the surfaces to maintain            
reflectivity. Stray light contamination was controlled by a system of baffles 
in the receive support structure to prevent off-axis light from reaching the  
primary mirror in less than two reflections. The two-reflection tolerance     
reduced the number of baffles, and hence, the weight of the receiver housing. 
Baffles, made of lightweight magnesium, were also knife-edged to minimize     
direct reflections into the receiver telescope.                               
The final mass of the telescope assembly (Fig. 9) was 167.4 g. Acceptance     
testing indicated that 98% of the focused energy was located within a 100-mm  
central (Airy) disk, easily accommodated by the 700-mm active diameter of the 
APD detector.                                                                 
To further reduce optical background noise, we placed a narrow-band (7 nm)    
spectral filter in the convergence cone of the telescope, a location selected 
to reduce weight and cost. Spectral filter passbands are strongly dependent on
temperature and angle of incidence. To minimize thermally induced performance 
variation, the filter was fabricated using a proprietary deposition process4  
that reduces passband shift by a factor of 10. We reduced angular sensitivity 
selecting a wide enough passband to allow light from all angles of the        
telescope, where the converging cone of light at the detector extends from 4  
to 9 , to pass with minimal attenuation. The relatively low orbital velocity  
of the spacecraft (5 m/s) imposed negligible Doppler requirement on filter    
bandpass performance.                                                         
A windowed door over the entrance aperture of the NLR receiver protects the   
optics from contamination. Our primary concern was contamination from         
byproducts arising from propellant burns during the transit phase, but the    
door also provided mechanical and contamination protection during prelaunch   
activities. The door is a deployable element meant to be opened once, which   
was successful accomplished on September 24, 1997. Both transmitter and       
receiver optical sections were kept under a positive purge using research-    
grade nitrogen prior launch with a purge valve in the receiver door for       
pressure relief. (The transmitter did not require a door; however, the        
transmitter was nevertheless kept under purge until final pressure            
equalization was reached subsequent to launch.) The door-release mechanism    
uses redundant pyrotechnic wire cutters with a tempered beryllium oxide wire. 
Six silica-coated windows are located on the receiver door to provide         
approximately 50% of the total collecting area in the event of a door-release 
failure at Eros. This 50% collection area will permit the NLR to operate at   
the planned orbital altitude (50 km).                                         
Analog Electronics                                                            
The purpose of the analog electronics is to convert backscattered optical     
energy from the asteroid surface into a digital STOP signal,permitting round- 
trip TOF measurements to be computed. Four fundamental stages compose the     
analog electronics (Fig. 10): the APD hybrid detector, a video amplifier, an  
integrator stage (Bessel-type lowpass filter), and a programmable comparator. 
The detector and amplifier are installed on a rigid-flex detector board where 
the detector electronics use 50-V matched lines; the integrator and comparator
are installed on a separate, analog signal processing board.                  
The APD is a hybrid device combining an enhanced silicon APD with temperature 
compensation and transimpedance amplification. The enhancement process pushes 
maximum response of the APD detector slightly beyond 1 mm. The particular APD 
used for the NLR is a wide field-of-view (FOV) detector with a measured band- 
width response of 37 MHz and responsivity of 770 kV/W. (For coherent laser    
radars, electronic bandwidth of the baseband signal relates to the FOV used in
observing the returned signal.) Assuming 15-ns pulses at 1.064 mm,our detector
circuit operates with a minimum detectable power of 9 nW and maximum input    
power of 0.5 W. Gain variation is less than 5% over the temperature range from
28 to 140 C due to compensation; however, our analog electronics housing is   
thermally controlled 20 6 10 C.                                               
The video amplifier stage consists of a wideband amplifier used to provide a  
gain of 150 over a 75-MHz bandwidth. The filtering, or integrator, stage is a 
seven-pole lowpass Bessel filter with 3-dB cutoff at 30 MHz. The lowpass      
filter is used to integrate return pulses that may be spatially dilated by    
interaction of the transmitted laser pulse with the asteroid's topology. The  
use of this filter optimizes the probability of detection of anticipated      
surface slopes while it limits high-frequency noise response of the analog    
electronics.5                                                                 
A comparator stage determines whether an input signal has sufficient energy to
generate a STOP signal. The comparator operates using one of eight preset     
threshold levels, which are set by ground command or auto-thresholding. These 
threshold levels vary from 16 to 2048 mV; the lowest threshold is below the   
receiver noise floor,and the highest setting is just above the signal strength
associated with the calibration input. Therefore, threshold levels increase as
2n Vth , where n = 0, . . . ,7 and Vth is the threshold voltage (16 mV).      
Thresholding permits an input dynamic range of 24 dB to compensate for        
instrument noise sensitivity and variations of return signal strength. The    
comparator exhibits very low propagation delay (<2 ns) and very little        
overdrive dispersion, making it ideal for precise timing applications such as 
leading-edge detection.6                                                      
Digital Processing Unit                                                       
To save weight and to minimize high-speed lines to the TOF chip, the DPU uses 
a single rigid-flex multilayered board (see Fig. 11). The board contains      
a GaAs TOF chip, a radiation-hardened RTX-2010 FORTH-language microcontroller,
dual-frequency stable oscillator, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip,
redundant-channel 1553 chip set and attendant transformers, digital memory, an
analog-to-digital (A/D) converter and sampler, and control logic.7 The dual-  
frequency oscillator produces two output frequencies: 480 MHz 60.01% and 48 MH
60.01%, with short-term (100 ms) frequency stability of 1:108, but only the 48
MHz frequency is used.The required 48-MHz clock is generated using the 480-MHz
frequency within the TOF ASIC. The FPGA uses this 48-MHz clock and produces 24
MHz, 2-MHz, and 500-kHz output clocks for the 1553-bus controller, RTX        
microcontroller, and FPGA internal range-gating counters, respectively.       
The GaAs TOF chip is an APL-designed ASIC with one 11-bit counter (used for   
calibration) and one 21-bit counter (used for range measurement with 1-bit    
overflow). Both counters operate at 480 MHz. The TOF counters are enabled with
a "start" pulse from the transmitter (START) and are stopped when a detected  
return pulse arrives from the receiver comparator (STOP). The RTX-2010 is a   
parallel 16-bit microcontroller that operates at 2 MHz to conserve power. The 
microprocessor chip contains three on-chip timers, a dual-stack architecture, 
and an interrupt controller with the ability to handle five external          
interrupts.                                                                   
The 1553-bus interface to the DPU consists of two 1553 bus transformers       
(channels A and B), a 1553 dual bus transceiver,and a bus protocol controller.
The controller responds to bus commands sent by the spacecraft command        
telemetry processor(CTP). The bus controller handles data transfers, commands,
and telemetry that transfer between the NLR and the CTP. Data bus arbitration 
is handled by our FPGA, which simplified digital hardware design and          
fabrication incorporating several functions such as address decoding, memory  
arbitration, clock generation, receiver range gating, receiver enable (denoted
T-0 masking) and transmitter and receiver configuration control.              
T-0 masking is necessary to eliminate spurious noise that is produced with the
formation of the laser optical pulse. T-0 masking is a disabling of the range 
counters (both calibration and return signal counters) for a few cycles of the
natural response of the receiver circuit at the time the optical pulse is     
formed within the laser transmitter. Without such masking, opportunities for  
false STOP signals are possible, and actual range measurements would not be   
possible. A second range-gating function is implemented to gate the return    
signal to improve the sensitivity of the NLR receiver.                        
The sought-after signal is the STOP indication, which is used to indicate a   
detected optical pulse above the set threshold. STOP terminates either the    
calibration or range TOF counter, depending on system configuration, and the  
corresponding range is read out.                                              
Software                                                                      
The NLR software was programmed using the FORTH programming language for the  
RTX-2010 microcontroller. The software interfaces with the spacecraft CTP via 
the 1553 bus, executes commands from the ground control, formats science      
telemetry and instrument housekeeping commands, and controls instrument       
operation. The software was implemented in a multitasking environment running 
four different NLR programs8: (1) "NLR_PROCESS" handles                       
transmitter/receiver control and data formatting; (2) "TELEMETRY_PROCESS"     
implements necessary 1553 protocol for data transfer; (3) "COMMAND_PROCESS"   
handles incoming instrument commands; and (4) "DUMP_PROCESS" transfer blocks  
of NLR memory to the telemetry stream for transmission to the ground.         
"NLR_PROCESS" is the main controlling program for the instrument. This task   
has the highest priority and requires 5 ms to execute. On the basis of a minor
frame interrupt (every 125 ms) arriving by the 1553 bus, this program         
determines when to fire the transmitter, initialize receiver parameters (i.e.,
T-0 mask, threshold level, and receiver range-gate), and read and format      
calibration and range counter values (i.e., the altimetry measurements).      
Measurement data, spacecraft time, and NLR configuration parameters are       
formatted into a science packet for each transmitter shot, with 56 shots (112 
for a pulse rate of 2 Hz) accumulated into each of these packets for          
transmission to ground via the downlink.                                      
"NLR_PROCESS" is programmed with several calibration algorithms. Operating    
during a contingency, or "fail-safe," mode, the TOF counter is started by a   
delayed transmitter fire command as opposed to an electronic trigger from the 
transmitter photodiode. This fire command is purposely delayed due to an      
inherently variable delay in the transmitter optical output, nominally 192 ms.
We can determine this delay by initiating a calibration mode that varies the  
T-0 mask through a 10-bit programmable counter until a reasonable calibration 
range is detected. Since the counter has a 500-ns resolution, the maximum     
range error due to a failed START would be 74.9 m.                            
The calibration algorithm configures the NLR to step through each threshold   
level and collect 16 samples of range and calibration data at a rate of 8 Hz. 
Collecting range data at 8 Hz minimizes the influence of relative movement    
between the NLR and asteroid terrain, permitting high correlation between data
points. This is important as range rate is calculated for each new sample at  
each threshold and is compared to a predetermined difference (sent as a       
command argument) to determine the system noise floor and, hence,the operating
threshold for reliable range returns. The 8-Hz mode occurs for a 2-s burst    
followed by a 14-s quiescent period to reduce thermal stresses within the     
transmitter. Following the 14-s pause, the NLR automatically reconfigures to  
the nominal 1-Hz rate.                                                        
In-line Optical Calibration                                                   
The NLR is the first laser altimeter to feature in-line calibration, which was
implemented using a 109.5-m single-mode fused silica optical fiber. This fiber
optic delay assembly (FODA) is optically connected between the transmitter and
receiver using small turning mirrors and graded-index lens assemblies.A minute
portion of each transmitted pulse is injected (using internal transmitter     
scattering at the corner cube, see Fig. 5) into the FODA, producing a constant
optical delay of 529.20 ns between transmitted pulse and reception of that    
pulse by the receiver optics; the measured delay after integration into the   
system was 558.33 ns, indicating an additional system bias of 29.13 ns. By    
directing each transmitted optical pulse directly to the receiver optics,     
"true" end-to-end calibration is possible, which allows detection of range-   
walk, an error caused by threshold-level changes or oscillator drift. This    
self-calibration feature, therefore, ensures high quality of the NLR data and 
permits evaluation of the NLR instrument functionality throughout the mission.
With the existence of the FODA, we essentially provide the NLR with a virtual 
fly-along laser radar target. This allows us to operate the NLR and obtain    
calibration measurements based on actual TOF readings using laser output power
until our arrival at Eros.                                                    
In addition to instrument operation,the FODA proved invaluable for performance
evaluation and debugging during prelaunch integration and test phases. Using  
the calibration range counter during testing allowed us to determine the      
quality of the instrument measurements based on threshold level selected,     
power levels used, operational mode selected, and various environmental       
conditions.                                                                   
NLR PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS                                                      
Performance was estimated using several approaches, including the basic radio-
metric modeling (Neyman Pearson detection) and Webb's9 photoelectron output   
approximation. Determination of the adequacy of the NLR design requires       
evaluation of performance given parameter values describing Eros, NLR mission 
parameters (e.g., orbit altitude), and the NLR design implementation. (Table 1
summarizes these parameters describing the NLR design.) Analytical evaluations
used these values to examine expected NLR performance through link margin     
calculations.                                                                 
Radiometric performance of the APD and associated analog electronics was      
particularly important. Using Neyman Pearson detection statistics, given the  
required detection probability (Pd = 0.95) and false alarms (<10 2), our      
performance model indicates ranging operation well beyond the required 50 km  
(Fig. 12). At 232 km, our analysis indicates  135 equivalent signal photons   
(N ) arriving at the NLR detector (APD) surface, providing a detection        
probability of 0.1 with false alarms of less than 0.01. Our detection scheme  
uses single-shot statistics; no multi-shot averaging is performed. At this    
range, we set the threshold level at 7s0 (s0 is the receiver noise floor power
level), providing false alarm count of 6   1024. Figure 12 illustrates        
detection probability and the number of source photons received at the        
detector as a function of range to the asteroid.                              
Because the NLR uses leading-edge detection, pulse dilation due to interaction
with the surface will introduce range error and can lead to performance loss  
as a result of receiver filter mismatch. This is especially true when we      
observe Eros at an angle, us, from nadir or when we range to a sloped surface 
(up, from the local horizon), or when significant surface roughness (Zrms)    
exists. Pulse dilation is defined as the temporal error in return pulse       
detection caused by elapsed time between the arrival of the initial and final 
backscattered photons for a given transmitter pulse, leading to error in      
measured TOF. Figure 13 illustrates these concepts for a divergence of ud,    
nadir altitude h0, mean slope of us, and an off-nadir look angle of up. An    
analysis10 was performed that estimates pulse dilation as a range error, Z(us,
up), within a footprint. Figure 14 is a plot of Z(us, up) using values of     
pointing angles and a range of slope values presumed for the NLR mission. The 
loci where we match the science requirement of 6-m error are shown in Fig. 14.
Pulse dilation can also occur as the result of beam wave-front curvature or   
variations in localized surface albedo. Additional range errors can arise from
electronic delay, timing errors, and incorrect correlation of attitude with   
range sample. Accounting for the various sources of range error with root-sum-
square error analysis, we determined that the NLR instrument will generate a  
topographic field that is accurate to  10 m with respect to Eros's center of  
mass.(This is an estimate of the accuracy using the entire NLR data set within
the ground-based data center.The NLR measures range to the asteroid's surface,
not to its center of mass, which must be estimated through numerous           
measurement made while NEAR orbits Eros.)                                     
NLR TESTING                                                                   
The NLR was tested at the instrument and spacecraft levels to ensure that it  
satisfied or exceeded all instrument and spacecraft requirements and that no  
adverse conditions existed that would jeopardize or corrupt spacecraft or     
other instrument operations. Instrument testing included functional,          
environmental, and end-to-end testing.                                        
Functional testing used ground support equipment (GSE) to simulate return     
signals for the NLR to operate with over simulated pulsewidths (dilation),    
return levels (simulating changes in range or albedo), and operational modes. 
Fiber-optic links allowed us to test throughout integration although the      
transmitter was a Class IV laser, which would have precluded open-air testing 
unprotected areas.                                                            
Environmental testing was performed to evaluate the NLR operation and         
performance under various operating conditions (variable spacecraft bus       
voltages, environmental temperatures and gradients, and modes of operation).  
Because the NLR produces high currents within its power supply to the         
transmitter ( 45 A), the influence on other spacecraft instruments (especially
the magnetometer) was evaluated. No interference was observed from the NLR    
using data from all NEAR instruments during repeated laser firings. This was  
verified during a post-launch interference test that was conducted in May     
1996.                                                                         
Finally, a free-space laser radar test was conducted to ensure end-to-end     
operation and to provide significant data and confidence in the ability of the
NLR to perform as required. Prior to this test, the NLR had been operated     
using GSE; the receiver was provided with a "simulated" return signal, and    
the transmitter was used only to provide timing for the return signal. Issues 
such as power level sensitivity, optical alignment, and attributes associated 
with overall system implementation were not quantifiable until this end-to-end
test was performed.                                                           
Functional Testing                                                            
A graded-index lens was attached to one of the windows in the aperture door to
provide access to the receiver prior to launch.A cap at the output aperture of
the NLR transmitter was installed that had a fiber-optic connector to allow   
access to the laser.Fiber-optic links allowed direct access to the transmitter
and receiver to permit simulation of effects during the environmental and     
functional tests without having to resort to open-air testing. This simulation
allowed significant testing without affecting people around the laser,        
especially during spacecraft integration activities. Fiber optics routed the  
transmitted pulse from the laser to the GSE, where a photodetector converted  
the optical signal into an electrical one for simulation of delay,signal level
changes, and pulse stretching. This modified signal was then sent to a GSE    
laser source, transforming the electrical signal back into an optical one.    
This modified optical signal could then be directed to the receiver, and NLR  
performance could be analyzed over a multitude of return signal conditions.   
Figure 15 presents data for a functional test performed on the NLR. The       
receiver was sequenced through a range of threshold levels, and range counters
were averaged over multiple laser firings at each of the threshold levels. The
data plots in Fig. 15 illustrate an expected error caused by the use of       
leading-edge detection, a condition denoted as range-walk. As the threshold   
levels are increased, increasingly more energy is required by the return pulse
to signal its arrival (which produces the STOP signal). Increased energy      
occurs later within the return pulse; thus the range indicated by the range   
counters increases with increased threshold levels, introducing a bias, or    
range-walk. The calibration curve shown in Fig. 15 illustrates a range-walk of
4 m over operational thresholds. The corresponding range-walk for range       
measurements is 2 m; the difference between the counters is that calibration  
measurements are one-way TOFs, whereas range is computed by dividing TOF by 2.
In the particular case shown, calibration data at the lowest threshold were   
unreliable and therefore not plotted. For range, the measurements were        
excessively noisy at the lowest two levels, indicating insufficient energy in 
the return pulse for reliable detection. However, once we used threshold      
levels set for operation (levels from n = 2 to n = 6 in the threshold equation
given earlier, 2n Vth), reliable calibration and range values were provided by
the tests.                                                                    
Environmental Testing                                                         
To ensure that the instrument would survive launch stresses and the NEAR space
environment, each NLR component was subjected to rigorous environmental       
testing. Such testing involved frequency-swept vibration levels, mechanically 
induced from 10 to 100 Hz at sweep rates of 4 octaves/min along the thrust-   
axis optical boresight. (Maximum amplitude of 15 g occurred from 30 to 40 Hz.)
Along the lateral axes, frequency range and rate were identical with maximum  
amplitudes occurring between 15 and 25 Hz of 7.5 g. The NLR instrument was    
also subjected to random vibration over frequencies of 20 2000 Hz for 60 s    
along each of the axes, with an overall root-mean-square amplitude of 13.6 g. 
Performance data were collected following each axis of vibration, and         
instrument alignment was verified before and after each test using two optical
methods. The first method measured the relative change between optical        
reference cubes mounted on the transmitter, receiver, and instrument base. The
alignment of these reference cubes was measured with a theodolite having      
2-arcsec precision. Transmitter-to-receiver alignment for our bistatic        
configuration was also determined by observing the transmitter beam in the    
receiver far-field FOV. This measurement was made by mapping the transmitter  
central lobe to the electronically determined FOV of the receiver.Measurements
indicated that the shifts induced by the mechanical vibration tests (345 mrad)
were well within the acceptable range (<1100 mrad), permitting reliable       
transmitter-to-receiver alignment.                                            
The operating temperature of the spacecraft is projected to be between 229 and
155 C,and the survival range is projected to be between 234 and 160 C. However
manufacturers' specifications for some of the NLR elements required that the  
components be maintained at a different temperature range. This was accomplish
through blanketing and heater control. We tested the adequacy of the NLR      
thermal design by testing the transmitter (laser) from 0 to 120 C,the receiver
optics from 110 to 130 C, and the NLR electronics from 229 to 155 C. Survival 
tests, during which the components are unpowered, increased the thermal range 
of operation testing by 5 C in each direction (e.g., transmitter survival     
testing range was increased to be from 25 to 125 C).                          
To evaluate the NLR over these ranges, we placed the entire integrated        
instrument (including all power supplies and flight cabling) in a thermal-    
vacuum (T-V) chamber and operated it over several thermal cycles. The T-V test
lasted for 5 days: 3 days involved actual testing and 2 days were required to 
attain stable thermal and vacuum conditions for operation. To characterize the
NLR while it was in the chamber, the previously described fiber-optic links   
were used to route the transmitter signal out of the chamber to the GSE and to
return the modified optical signal back into the chamber to the receiver,     
permitting continuous performance evaluation. To prevent corona and to ensure 
reliable operation of the NLR,the instrument was soaked in vacuum (<1025 torr)
for the initial 36 h before it was powered.                                   
We evaluated calibration data during the T-V testing, collecting over 200     
range measurements at various threshold levels for each of the three platea   
temperatures investigated, 229, 125, and 155 C. When operation at 155 C was   
compared with operation at 229 C, a very slight thermal influence on NLR      
performance was found; the range shifted by less than 0.5 ns ( 15 cm).        
End-to-End System Test                                                        
An end-to-end system test, conducted under moderately controlled conditions in
a 216.4-m-long hallway at APL, verified that the NLR operated as a laser      
altimeter system. The NLR was configured to fire at 1 Hz at two distinct      
targets, one at time. One target, a sand-blasted aluminum sheet, could be     
characterized as a Lambertian scatterer. The second target, a silicate-rich   
rock, was use to represent more of what we expect of Eros's surface. Figure 16
shows these targets; the white circle on the targets in Fig. 16a is the actual
Nd:YAG infrared beam; the camera used to photograph is a charge coupled device
camcorder and is sensitive to the near infrared. Data were collected at one   
range for the aluminum target and at two separate ranges for the rock target. 
Target ranges varied between 182 and 211 ft, with actual values determined    
using a NIST-traceable 91.44-m surveyor's rule. The data, as represented in   
Fig. 16a illustrate the insignificant noise and error levels associated with  
NLR operation.                                                                
To simulate actual operating distances (nominally 50 km) for the NLR, we used 
neutral density filters and an aperture stop for a total attenuation of 71 dB.
The graphs in Fig. 16 show range data from the NLR for operational threshold  
levels. As expected, at the lowest threshold levels noise dominated,and at the
highest threshold levels no returns were detected.                            
Given the binary-increasing (octave) scaling used to create the threshold     
level (recall that comparator voltage levels vary as 2n Vth), the operational 
threshold at n = 5 is  9 dB above the receiver noise floor. With the 71-dB    
attenuation, estimated link margin for the NLR operating at 50 km to Eros is  
estimated to be 9 12 dB. The 3-dB granularity cannot be improved upon using   
these test data because the data were taken using the eight-valued preset     
threshold scheme.                                                             
SUMMARY                                                                       
The successful launch of the NEAR spacecraft from Cape Canaveral on 17        
February 1996 at 3:43 EST was only the beginning. Three tests performed       
subsequent to launch indicated satisfactory operation of the NLR. The actual  
Eros rendezvous is scheduled for February 1999. From the substantial surface  
coverage of Eros the NLR and the altimeter's expected resolution and accuracy 
performance, the resulting measurements should significantly enhance our      
understanding of asteroid structure. In addition to instrument-level testing, 
the NLR underwent spacecraft qualification testing as an integrated           
instrument. Figure 17 depicts the NLR located on the NLR instrument deck (note
the nonflight, red caps that were used to protect the optics prior to launch).
Although the NLR was a relatively simple laser radar compared with designs    
commonly in use by terrestrial laser rangefinders, the combined requirement of
operating an instrument in deep space for a prolonged period under strong     
design constraints (weight, cost, and schedule) contributed significantly to  
the complexity of this instrument. Fortunately, radiation effects for the NEAR
mission are slight (10-krad total dose); nevertheless, space exposure         
influenced our selection and design approach for the electronics and the
