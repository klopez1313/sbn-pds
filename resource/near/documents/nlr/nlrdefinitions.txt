        The NLR receiver is 'blanked', or prevented from detecting a pulse,   
        for a time interval T0 after the fire command. This T-0 mask is set   
        by ground command with a default value of 180.498 ms. In-flight tests 
        have shown that this default value, as well as values half as large,  
        are sufficient to suppress any electronic noise from firing. The value
        of T0 is adjusted by two parameters returned in the NLR data; the     
        first is called "T0_COUNT" and is represented here by the symbol d,   
        while the second is called "Range gate" and is represented by the     
        symbol rg. This "Range gate" parameter does not define a range gate   
        in the usual sense of a brief time interval, during which the receiver
        is active, encompassing the time of the expected range return. Rather,
        the NLR receiver becomes active once the time T0 has elapsed, and it  
        remains active until two stop pulses are generated, one from the      
        calibration return and one from the target. The relation between T0   
        and the commandable parameters d and rg is where T0 is in units of ms,
        and where d and rg are both integers in the range [0, 1023] is:       
              T0 = 0.081 +RANGE_GATE * 0.0417 + TO_COUNT*0.5

        definition - The NLR timing shown in Fig 2 applies to normal operation
         at any of the four PRF values. NLR also includes two special failure 
         modes of operation, that can be used in the event of failures        
         involving either the start pulse or the calibration pulse. In the    
         former case, the FAILSAFE mode starts the TOF counters at the final  
         value of the "T-0 COUNT" countdown. In the latter case, the          
         ONESTOP mode causes NLR to use the first received stop pulse as the  
         range pulse from the target. As of September, 1999, the start and c  
         alibration pulses are functioning nominally, and there is no plan    
         to use either FAILSAFE or ONESTOP. FAILSAFE and ONESTOP are set to   
         1 if in use.

        calibration pulse to find a threshold voltage above the noise         
        level in the receiver. NLR fires 16-shot bursts at each of the        
        eight possible values for the voltage threshold (listed in Table 1),  
        which are labeled TH = 0 through TH = 7. AUTO_ACQ_MODE = 1 when       
        in this mode.

        definition - NLR is the first laser altimeter to employ continuous,   
    in-flight calibration using a fiber-optic delay assembly (FODA), which    
    is a spooled, 109.5-m fused silica fiber-optic cable. Part of each        
    optical pulse formed within the laser resonator is injected into the      
    FODA, which is connected to the baffle system in front of the receiver    
    telescope. Using a 45o elliptical mirror, the delayed optical signal is   
    directly introduced into the receiver. This allows end-to-end             
    calibration for each emitted pulse even when no target surface is         
    available.  NORMAL_RATE_CALIB is the cal word of one shot, minus 256,     
    expressed as unsigned integer.
