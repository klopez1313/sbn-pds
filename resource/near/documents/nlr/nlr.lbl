In 1999, after a 3-year transit through space, the Near Earth Asteroid        
Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft will place a scientific payload consisting of    
five instruments into a low-altitude orbit ( 35 km) about the asteroid 433    
Eros for 1 year. One instrument, the NEAR Laser Rangefinder (NLR), will use   
infrared laser pulses to provide astrophysicists with precision altimetry data
measurements that were previously unavailable from asteroid observations.     
These data will accurately map Eros's topology, identify and characterize     
small-scale surface features, a precisely determine overall volume and mass   
once they are combined with navigation data. Objectives associated with the   
NLR science mission are presented along with performance specifications and   
instrument design details. The method by which NLR performance was analyzed is
described, as are tests us to verify its performance and operability. During  
performance testing, an 'end-to-end' test was conducted, where the integrated 
NLR instrument was operated in free space using a 216.4-m hallway. Test       
results fully verified all instrument interfaces and indicated that NLR per-  
formance parameters were well within all specifications. In addition, range   
noise and biases were repeatable to 1 count, which is the minimum level       
possible for a direct-detection rangefinder.
