Parameter (EOP) files and the Universal Time and Polar Motion (UTPM) files    
received from the Tracking System Analytic Calibration (TSAC) group.(NOTE:    
These files are now produced by the Time and Earth Motion Precision

Revisions or changes to the information herein presented may be initiated in

GENERAL INFORMATION                                                           
                                                                              
The DSN and flight projects use EOP data, which includes UTPM data, in the    
process of performing orbit determination and generating prediction data.     
These data are to be provided at intervals determined by the user's accuracy  
requirements and as negotiated with the various DSN and project users.        
                                                                              
Two different file formats are described in this interface document. The first
kind of file contains Universal Time and Polar Motion (UTPM) data only, and   
has the same format as was described in the previous version of TRK-2-21.  It 
will be referred to hereafter as the UTPM STOIC file; in the past, such files 
have also been called TPOLY files or TP arrays. The second kind of file       
contains UTPM data and, in addition, nutation correction parameters necessary 
to determine inertial station locations at the few-cm level. It will be       
referred to as the EOP file. For a detailed explanation of the models         
underlying this file, and how the file is used, see Folkner et al., "Earth    
Orientation Parameter (EOP) file description and usage," JPL IOM 335.1-11-93, 
May 21, 1993.                                                                 
                                                                              
The data are deliverable via electrical interface.                            
                                                                              
UTPM STOIC DATA FORMAT                                                        
                                                                              
UTPM STOIC data are available as ASCII files in Fortran Namelist format.  The 
data file consists of 88 card-image records. In Fortran Namelist format, each 
variable in a single record is of the form                                    
                                                                              
     variable(i) = value(i), value(i+1), value(i+2)...value(i+j-1),           
                                                                              
where i is an index running from 1 to 335 and j is the number of data values  
of the variable given on a single record. The subscripts i+1 through i+j are  
not given explicitly.                                                         
                                                                              
Two different UTPM STOIC files are available, identical except for the time   
tags, generally referred to as "seconds past 2000" or "seconds past 1950" (see
TIME below).  All time rates of change are with respect to International      
Atomic Time (TAI).                                                            
                                                                              
    Specific inputs are as follows:                                           
                                                                              
     First record:    TIMPOL    A label giving the date of the last input     
                                datum (LD) and the last date for which        
                                predictions are given, typically 30 days      
                                after the file is generated (PT). For Univac  
                                deliveries, the LD/PT portion names the       
                                Univac element. (See Figures TRK-2-21-1 and   
                                TRK-2-21-2 for LD and PT locations.) For      
                                UTPM STOIC files created since 1 May 1993, a  
                                variable called UT1TYP has been placed at     
                                the end of TIMPOL. Only two values are        
                                allowed, either UT1TYP=UT1R   or              
                                UT1TYP=UT1. Older UTPM STOIC files are all    
                                UT1R unless the string UT1 tidal terms        
                                appears at the end of TIMPOL. See the UT1R

EOP DATA FORMAT                                                               
                                                                              
EOP data are available as ASCII files in Navigation Portable Namelist format. 
(Navigation Portable Namelist is a Namelist processor written and maintained  
by the Navigation Software Development Group.)  In addition to the inclusion  
of nutation parameters, the EOP file differs from the UTPM STOIC file in other
important ways:                                                               
                                                                              
The EOP file may be of any length, whereas the UTPM STOIC file is limited to  
13 records for TAI-UTC, 37 records for TAI-UT1, and 37 records for polar-     
motion X and Y.                                                               
                                                                              
All EOP data for a single time tag are in a single record, whereas the UTPM   
STOIC file has three different record types depending on the data type, as    
noted above.                                                                  
                                                                              
EOP time tags are expressed as Modified Julian Dates; UTPM STOIC time tags are
seconds past a particular epoch, such as 12:00 noon, 1 Jan. 2000, or 0 hours, 
1 Jan. 1950.                                                                  
                                                                              
All characters in a line following a dollar sign ($) are comments included for
convenience but ignored by all programs. Specific inputs are as follows:

                                    as the TIMPOL record in the UTPM STOIC    
                                    file.                                     
                                                                              
     EOPFNG      character*80       This text label gives the name of the     
                                    program used to produce the EOP file, the 
                                    date and time the file was generated, and 
                                    the date and time the program was linked. 
                                                                              
     EOPUT1      character*6        This flag indicates whether the data in   
                                    the file contain TAI-UT1 or TAI-UT1R. The 
                                    two possible values of this variable are  
                                    'UT1' and 'UT1R'.                         
                                                                              
     EOPTYP      character*6        This flag is used by the ODP to determine 
                                    whether to use the EOP array or the UTPM  
                                    STOIC (TP) array for the computation of   
                                    Earth orientation. The allowed values of  
                                    this variable are 'EOP' and 'STOIC'.

EOP records are in strictly increasing time order and may have any record     
spacing (not necessarily uniform). The file must contain a record at the      
Modified Julian Date where each leap second occurs within the span of the     
file. The number of records required depends upon the data span and the       
desired accuracy. Random variations of UT1 are of the order of 0.07 ms in one 
day, corresponding to about 3 cm on the surface of the Earth. Systematic sub- 
daily tidal variations of both UT1 and polar motion exist, also with          
approximately 3-cm amplitudes. The spacing used in currently delivered EOP    
files is one day, to allow modeling inertial station locations with           
approximately 3-cm accuracy. The file format allows records to be more closely
spaced if greater accuracy is desired.

CEP        Celestial Ephemeris Pole: A direction in space, which varies from  
           day to day, about which the Earth appears to rotate on any         
           particular day. The CEP differs from the instantaneous rotation    
           axis of the Earth by periodic terms with amplitudes less than 30   
           cm. It differs from the pole of the celestial reference frame      
           (ICRF pole; see below) by quantities given by the IAU standard     
           nutation and precessional models (IAU 1980 Theory of Nutation; IAU 
           1976 Precession) and the offsets (dEps and dPsi; see below) from   
           those models.

Nutation   The action of the sun and moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge     
           causes small variations in the direction of the CEP. The short-    
           period (periods less than or equal to 18.6 years) portion of these 
           variations is called nutation; the long-period portion is called   
           precession, and is treated as secular (nonperiodic).

UTC        Coordinated Universal Time: Civil time, formerly called GMT. A     
           time scale running at the same rate (by definition) as TAI, except 
           for the introduction of leap seconds by the IERS as required to

           corrected for polar motion and measured in time units; also        
           formerly called GMT. It is related to the direction of the IRM in  
           the ICRF, measured around the CEP axis.                            
                                                                              
UT1R       UT1 with the effects of short-term tides removed. Short-term tidal 
           effects on UT1 have periods ranging from approximately 5 to 35     
           days. Long-term tidal effects have periods ranging from            
           approximately 91 days to 18.6 years, and are included in UT1R. The 
           quantities noted as "UT1" in the UTPM STOIC file description       
           or in the EOP file description will always be either all UT1 or    
           all UT1R in a particular file.                                     
                                                                              
X,Y        Coordinates of the Celestial Ephemeris Pole relative to the IERS   
           Reference Pole. X is measured along the IRM; Y is measured along   
           the meridian 90 degrees W of the IRM.
