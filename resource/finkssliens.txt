Fink Images and Spectra of Solar System Bodies
==============================================

Documentation:

1.  Improve the instrument descriptions, merging the imaging instrument
descriptions into one, correcting inconsistencies in the description
of the spectrograph, and specifying what is not known and what is
uncertain.  If possible, find more recent references to cite about the
spectrograph.

2.  Double quotes have been used as an abbreviation for inches and arcseconds
but double quotes are not allowed in PDS text fields so OLAF converts
them to single quotes.  Go through and spell them all out as inches and
arcseconds.  This affects both the data set description and the
instrument descriptions.

3.  Correct typo "haeding" to heading in Ancillary Data section of data set
description.

4.  Document the file name convention(s) in the data set description.

5.  Document in the confidence level note that the image orientation
is in the PDS labels and there is no image orientation information in the
FITS headers.  Thus any display software which reads only the FITS headers
and not the PDS labels may not display with the correct orientation, which
is N up and E to the left.

6.  Explain briefly in the confidence level note about the dichroic and how
it results in some images having the same start and stop times.

7.  Update the citation description to the year the data are archived
(presumeably 2017).  [OLAF automatically uses the year the data set was
generated, so this should be taken care of.]

8.  Provide a file documenting the original orientation of the images
in a run.

9.  Make the "reviewed" log files more consistent and highlight the lines that
have a log entry but not corresponding uploaded data files.  

10.  In the document descriptions for the log files, note that some log
entries pertain to data which is not yet included in the data set, and
specify which these are.  [Putting this information in the document label
description automatically puts it into docinfo.txt.]

11.  The document labels for the logs point to their document files
incorrectly.  This is an OLAF problem which must be corrected before the
data set is regenerated for archiving.

Data labels:

12.  Image labels associated with instrument I0043 list a variety of values
for pixel scale.  Use a single value which agrees with the value given in
the instrument description.

13.  Some data files have the same start time.  For some this is correct
because of the dichroic, but others represent duplicated files or other
errors.  Track down all these and correct.

14.  The target name SKY must be associated with the target type CALIBRATION.
Suggested solution is to change the target name to something like
OFFSET_SKY.  Use this or another acceptable solution that is consistent with
PDS standards.

15.  The labels say horizontal and vertical pixel FOV, but the value given
is pixel scale (as prompted by OLAF).  This has to be fixed in OLAF before
the data set is regenerated for archiving.

For the future:  Provide a file listing the solar system objects observed,
when they were observed, and in what mode.  It may make sense to do this
only in the next update when all the data have been included.

This data set is certified.  No further external review is needed after
liens resolution is complete.
