        <h1>PDS4 Line Feed Changes</h1>

        <p>The Planetary Data System will soon be making a change to the data model that might impact some of the tools you use to work with future PDS4 data.</p>

        <h2>What's changing?</h2>
        <p>We will begin to allow new variations of line ending markers in digital files. Previously, we enforced Windows format (<mono>CR+LF</mono>), and are planning to expand that to support Unix-based (<mono>LF</mono>). This affects the parsing of PDS4 data and document files, and some tools may need to be updated in order to accommodate for this new format.</p>

        <h2>What are line feed characters?</h2>
        <p>In digital files, special invisible "control characters" are used to indicate when a line has ended. These may be used in a text document, table, image, or any other format. In Windows and most older computing systems, this is indicated with two adjacent characters: "Carriage Return" (<mono>CR</mono>, Hex <mono>0xD</mono>, <mono>"\r"</mono>) and "Line Feed" (<mono>LF</mono>, Hex <mono>0xA</mono>, <mono>"\n"</mono>). On Unix-based systems like Mac and Linux, this is typically represented as a single Line Feed character instead. Further background can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>How will this affect me?</h2>
        <p>If you use your own custom software or scripts to parse and use data from the PDS, this may need to be updated to support this change.</p>
        <p>If you use software distributed by the PDS on our archived data, you will need to download the latest versions when those are available at the same time this change is made (date TBD).</p>

        <h2>What might I need to change in my code?</h2>
        <p>Maybe nothing! If you use widely-distributed image/text/file parsing libraries in your code, many of them already know how to handle variable format line endings.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, you will need to inspect your code for any place you are expecting a <mono>CR+LF</mono> newline, and modify it to expect <em>either</em> <mono>CR+LF</mono> or <mono>LF</mono>. Note that errors might occur if you switch to just expecting <mono>LF</mono>; the trailing <mono>CR</mono> could cause issues. You must handle <em>both</em> cases.</p>
        <p>In many programming languages (like Python), these characters are represented in code by <mono>"\n"</mono> (for LF) and <mono>"\r"</mono> for carriage return. So in those cases, you would need to change any code that expected <mono>"\r\n"</mono> to also expect <mono>"\n"</mono>.</p>

        <h2>What do I <em>not</em> need to worry about?</h2>
        <p>Data that has already been archived with the existing standards will not be changing, and can continue to be used with any tools out there today. This change will only affect some data files archived in the future model versions (date TBD).</p>
        <p>Software written and distributed by the PDS will be updated to work with this new format at the same time, so you will not need to modify that software, merely use the most updated versions.</p>

        <h2>I am a data provider, how will this affect me?</h2>
        <p>This is merely an addition to what's allowed in our standards. Any existing data that you provide will continue to be archivable. Going forward though, you will have more flexibility in the types of files you can archive, or the amount of work you need to put in to make your data archive-ready.</p>

        <h2>Where can I get more help or send feedback?</h2>
        <p>We know this may cause issues with some scripts/software, and are providing this advance notice in case it causes any undue hardship. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:sbn@psi.edu">sbn@psi.edu</a> if you have further questions, need help understanding how to update any tools you use, or know of any issues that this would cause that might require a delay to this implementation.</p>
