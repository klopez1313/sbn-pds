        <center><h1>PDF/A Converting and Validation</h1></center>

        <p>
        PDF is a standard for encoding documents in an "as printed" 
            form that is portable. PDF/A was developed as an 
            international standard to define the use of PDF for 
            archiving. <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A#Background">[1]</a></li>
        </p>
        <p>
        To check if your PDF is conformed correctly, we have some tools below to aid in that process.
        </p>

            <h2> PDF/A Validation </h2>
            <li><a href="http://verapdf.org/software/">Verapdf</a>: Software</li>
        </center>
        <br>
        <p>
            This webpage is where you can download a validation software
            package for PDF/A. If you don'y have JAVA, you would need to 
            download that first. They do have versions for Windows, Mac,
            and Linux. If you need assistance in installing this package, 
            they have a link to their GitHub directory on the page.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Once the program is installed, you can either run the GUI version
            or run the program from the command line.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For the command line, ./verapdf -f 1b --format text pdf_file 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For the GUI, there will be a line of text that appears in the 
            empty space next to the Execute button. The PDF/A flavour we're
            looking for is PDF/A-1A, with PDF/A-1B being good enough. If 
            it's valid, the text will be green. If it's invalid, the text 
            will be red.
        </p>
        <br>
        <center>
            <h2> PDF/A Conversion </h2>
        </center>

        <br>
        <p>
            We have a converter to PDF/A for those that have a Mac or Linux system
        </p>
        <br>
        <center>
        <li><a href="https://www.ghostscript.com/">https://www.ghostscript.com/</a></li>
        </center>
        <p>
            The converter script we have needs Ghostscript to run. This link 
            will bring you to the Ghostscript website, where you are 
            able to download it for your system.
        </p>

        <p>
            This link will download a zip file with all the files that you
            would need to convert a PDF to a PDF/A-1B. It will make a copy 
            of the file you want to convert. The copy file will look like: name.pdfa.pdf
            From the command line: ./pdf2pda pdf_file
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If it comes back as a FAIL, then the program couldn't convert the 
            PDF file. In that situation, you will have to look for other means
            of converting the file. If it comes back as a PASS, that means the
            copied file will be conformed to PDF/A-1B standards and you are ready
            to submit your document to us for archiving.
